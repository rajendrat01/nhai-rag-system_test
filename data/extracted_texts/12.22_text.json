To begin with about 10 \nproposal of VUP /LVUP in a financial year per Regional officers are planned. \nImplementation of removal of at-grade junctions will be monitored through data \nlake portal which will capture all activities since identification till implementation. The \nentire procedure of submission forwarding / approval of the proposals therefor be \nupdated on data lake portal. 2 \nThe PIUs shall be responsible for identification of such locations and compile data \nin a format on the data lake portal. Regional Officers prioritise based on criterion given \nbelow and then forward the same to Member concerned at HQ, Member concerned taking \nnote of the overall projections direct ROs/PIUs to submit the detailed proposal. The \nproposals shall be approved as per the extant delegation of powers for Change of Scope/ \nO&M works. 3. \nAbove exercise will exclude the junctions already covered under the list of 4. \nblackspots maintained by MoRTH, for which the delegation as prescribed in policy circular \ndated 1.1.31/2019 dated 19.12.2019 shall continue to be followed. \nFor provision of VUP / LVUP criteria already laid down in the Manual shall be \nfollowed and prioritise on the basis of junction with NH, SH, Industrial parks, others \ncategory roads. Junction under specific category say junction with NH further be prioritise \nbased on traffic and accidents. For VUP in urban areas three spans are recommended to \nfacilitate u turn movement. While planning, it also need to be ensured that adequate sight \ndistance is available on VUP/LVUP locations. In this regard guidelines issued vide policy \ncircular no. 10. 1.18/2019 dated 30.04.2019 may be followed. All the above measures are \nsuggested for completed four/six lanes NH. 5. \n6.
