Accordingly, the Sample Executive Summary under Para-11 of TOR provides that the Consultant should submit a summary of these opportunities for Value Engineering and Introduction of New Technology that will help in reducing the cost of project or increase quality & longevity of the project road_ 2 The Ministry vide Circular No. RW /NH-33044/18/2020-S&R (P&B) dated 14.12.2020 (copy enclosed as Annexure-I) has issued   guidelines on use of New/ Alternative Material and Technology in Construction of Highways. It has also been mentioned that the stretches where new material/ technology is used for which Codes, Standards, Specifications, Guidelines etc. of IRC , MoRTH, AASHTO, ASTM; Euro Code and British Codes, FHWA guidelines are not available, the project may be taken Up on pilot basis and the Defects Liability Period of such project stretches shall be 10 years. 3 In view of the above, directions are hereby issued that henceforth all the Consultants should necessarily and clearly specify, in the DPRs, the details on Value Engineering and introduction of cost effective & environment friendly New/ Alternative Material and Technology in construction of Project Highway. In order to promote new material/ technology, the DPR Consultants and Technical Divisions with the approval of Member concerned, should specify in Schedule-B various types of New/ Alternative Material and   Technology to be used in constructing the project highway for minimum 10% length including mandatory use of Waste Plastic for 5% length. 4 In the case of on-going projects, the waste plastic shall be utilised for a minimum 5% length of project highway and in case of overlays as part of O&M activities, the use of waste plastic shall be the default mode of construction: 5. Some salient features and recommendations while using various types of New Materials and Technologies in construction of highways are summarized below for guidance: Cement Treated Base (CTB) Layer: Stage construction is not allowed for pavements with cement treated bases and sub- bases. The aggregate gradation for CTB shall be as given in table 400-4 of MoRTH Specifications. The CTB material shall have a minimum Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of 4.5 to 7 MPa as per IRC:SP:89 in 7/28 days: For the functional requirement, the thickness of cement treated bases shall not be less than 100 mm Contd: 2 9 099 NHAL 2nd Reg:",
