OWAAKA NEW DELHI-110045 No. 11041/21/2002/Admn.-III February 2003 POLICY MATTER ADMINSTRATIONFINANCE (34/2003) Sub::  Payment of retainership fee (Contractor's Share) of Dispute Review Expert Member or Chairman of  Dispute Review Board after release of final bill payment. As per the provisions of the respective contract agreement; Dispute Review Expert (DRE) & Dispute Review Board (DRB) have been appointed for each of the contract package to settle the disputes, if any, arising in respect of the said agreement between NHA and the contractor: As per terms.& conditions of the agreement; services of DREIDRB are required during the period of Contract i.e. up to defect liability with authorized extension(s) of time, if any. Further, payment to the DREIDRB is to be shared equally between NHAI & the Contractor: The payment of retainership fee, etc. to the DREIDRB is being made by NHAI initially contractor's share is deducted from their bills subsequently. 2. However, it has been observed in some of the cases that the payment of final bill is released to the contractor before expiry of defect liability period  As the payment to DREIDRB has to be made till the completion of defect liability period, it becomes difficult for NHAI to recover contractor's share subsequently after all payments due to the Contractor are settled 3. To streamline the procedure, it has been decided with the approval of the Competent Authority that in such cases   where the payment of final bill is proposed to be made to the contractor before the expiry of defect liability period; the share of retainership fee payable by the Contractor be deducted from the final bill payment of the Contractor for the remaining tenure of DREIDRB.
