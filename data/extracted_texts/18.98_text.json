No. 158387)} (In supersession of earlier Policy Circular No. 18.69 dated 03rd November 2021) Sub: Recording of High-Resolution Imagery from Drone of Project Highway during the Development, Construction and O8M Period and Implementation of   Drone Analytics Monitoring System (DAMS) reg: With the objective to bring Transparency, Uniformity and use of Latest Technology, High Resolution Imagery through Drones of the entire ROW capturing the Progress of the Projects, Road Condition, Road Furniture, etc. has been made mandatory: 2. Scope of High-Resolution Imagery: All Projects starting from issuance of Appointed Date till completion of construction Drone Surveys shall be carried out: In addition, Projects under O&M shall also be covered: Periodicity for Projects under implementation shall be monthly' and for Projects under O&M 'Six monthly\" 3 Role of Drone Service Providers (DSP): NHAI has empanelled zone-wise Drone Service Providers (DSP) for conducting Drone Survey of Project Highway during the Development, Construction, and O8M Period. Further, the Authority is in process of increasing the numbers of empanelled agencies. Drone Survey shall be carried out only through empanelled DSPs. The DSP shall conduct Survey in conformity to the revised SOP on approved per km. rates. 4 Revised SoP for high resolution imagery through Drones: Capturing of High-Resolution Imagery through Drones shall be as per the revised Standard Operating Procedure (SoP), copy attached at Annexure-I. This revised SOP shall come into force W.e.f. O1st October 2024. 5_ Work Orders and execution schedules: To ensure uniform time bound execution, the system generated work orders along with schedules to DSP for Drone Survey on all eligible Projects shall be issued from Data Lake on every 15th calendar day with a copy to concerned PD and the RO. The Drone Survey should be conducted and completed preferably in the last week every month such that its results can be used to prepare the MPR in the subsequent month: In addition to the prescribed schedules, PDs/ ROs can also undertake need based Drone Survey as and when required on the Project through the DSPs. The system generated scheduling of Drone Survey shall take care of gap of three months between NSV and Drone Survey respectively. Tentative six monthly schedule for O&M Projects is enclosed at Annexure-II. Contd_2I - A 7 T 9 NHAI",
