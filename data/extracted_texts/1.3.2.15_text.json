A permanent cadre of NHAI has now been created by recruiting absorbing officers at various appropriate level: With the coming into being of a permanent cadre of NHAI, a need was felt to rethink placing of varioUs officers in field assignments i.e. Project Implementation Units, Regional Offices and at Headquarters. The permanent cadre of NHAI consists of a mix bag of people who have come from diverse sources and backgrounds unlike earlier stream when most of the officers came from MoRTH: 2 The personnel  strategy was proposed to the Authority in its 92nd Meeting held on 30.01.2013 with a view to have permanent cadre which will be well experienced in handling of various National Highway Development Projects (NHDP) and will provide an exposure of field to all the officers by placing them as Project Directors of Project Implementation Units (PIU) . It was also considered that Regional Officer is a geographical link between a group of Project Implementation Units (PIUs) and Headquarters, therefore; for the senior level officers exposure should be given to them before posting them aS Regional Officers and at Headquarters. The duties of a Regional Officer are more administrative and coordinating in nature and less technical. A Regional Officer has to liaise and interact with the State Governments in his jurisdiction on matters relating to land acquisition, Utility shifting and environment and forest clearance and such other issues. Therefore, Regional Officers are generally posted in the rank of CGM: 3_ The above personel strategy was considered with a view to ensure that NHAI is able to build a permanent cadre of NHAI officers where senior officers should have knowledge and experience of overall activities of NHAI especially that of Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and contract management as those are the core of business of NHAI.
