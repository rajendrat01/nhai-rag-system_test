However, it has been observed that some of the Concessionaires/Contractors have not come forward for amicable settlement of disputes/claims in respect of all their cases under a particular contract; pending either before AT or Court of Law. It cannot, therefore, be considered a one-time settlement as all the pending disputes/claims have not been placed before the 3 CGMs' Committee. 2 For any meaningful negotiations for settlement of a dispute, it is desirable that all known disputes/claims are dealt by the 3 CGMs' Committee. The Committee may, therefore, like to clarify this aspect from a Concessionaire/Contractor and if any valid reasons are forth for non- inclusion of a particular dispute, the 3 CGMs\" Committee may, in its discretion, proceed with the negotiation of the disputelclaim requested by the Concessionaire/Contractor. 3. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. Yours faithfully, (PC. Grover ) Chief General Manager(Legal) To: AICGMs(Tech) 67am Nma put",
