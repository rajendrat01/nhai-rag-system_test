In these Circulars specific note has been provided which states that \"since the fee structure has to be agreed by both the parties (i.e. NHAI and the   Contractor/Supervision Consultant); the above fee structure may  also be got accepted by the   respective   Contractor/Supervision Consultant  through  supplementary agreement, A draft supplementary agreement incorporating the above provision is enclosed as Annexure. The concerned Member/CGM may ensure that this is adhered to strictly: In case of future contracts, the fee structure may be included as part of bidding documentlcontract document and the acceptance of above fee structure the Contractor/Supervision may be kept as a pre condition for signing the contract: 2 However, it is noticed that very few supplementary agreements for ongoing projects have been entered with the Contractor/Supervision Consultants and in very few contracts the fee structure has been included as part of contract documents. It is therefore suggested that all the Project  Directors may be advised to direct all the Contractors/Supervision Consultants working under their PIUs to enter in to an agreement on the fee structure of Arbitrators in accordance with the latest Policy Circular No. 21/2008 dated 07.01.2008. It is also suggested that in future contracts, the fee structure may be included as part of Bidding Documents/Contract Document and the acceptance of the fee structure by the Contractors/Supervision Consultant may be kept as a precondition for signing the contract. 3 This issues with the approval of Chairman. b1y (S.K.
