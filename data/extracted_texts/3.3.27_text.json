On careful examination of the matter; NHAI has observed that recovery of amount already to concessionaire and payment of GST on change in law impact o EPC cost along with annuity payments in a span Of 15 years shall result in delay of payment of change in law compensation as the significant cash outflows are incurred at the time of EPC cost to the concessionaire. Hence; it has been decided to pay the change in law impact/amount attributable to EPC Cost at the time of completion of construction work and balance amount of change in law shall be paid starting from such annuity as calculated from Annexure-III: An illustration regarding this is given below: Wlustration 1 Let_us assume: BPC Cost plus escalation Rs. 100 Crores ii .
