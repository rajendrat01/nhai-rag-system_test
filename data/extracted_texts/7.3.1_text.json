September 16, 2004 POLICY MATTERS TECHNGAL (44/2004) (Decision taken on note of Member(Admn) dated 13.09.2004.) There are several Rail Over Bridges (ROBs) being constructed on the NHDP either - through the Ministry of Railways or the contractors of specific packages. It has been seen that sufficient preventive measures are not being taken to ensure safety of the passengers on the approaches of these RoBs. Certain incidents have come to notice where the users of the road have gone up on the finished or semi-finished approach roads of the RoBs to discover suddenly that the structure has not been completed. These incidents could have resulted in very serious accidents. It is only by chance that some of these potentially serious have been averted. The matter cannot be left to chance. All PDs must immediately ensure that the approach roads to the RoBs, which are under construction, are properly blocked and suitable signboards are provided to warn the traffic: These signboards should be of reflective type so that these are visible in the night also. In cases where are construction is being done by the contractor of the packages, the consultants and the PDs should immediately ensure that suitable precautions have been taken: In case such construction is being done by the Railways, steps should be taken to ensure that the authorities cf the Railways take full precautions so that nothing untoward happens. If Railways fail to take suitable precautions, the matter should be brought immediately to the attention of the concerned MemberICGM Similar   precautions should be taken in case of  flyovers,  underpasses and other structures_ This issues with approval of the Competent Authority.
