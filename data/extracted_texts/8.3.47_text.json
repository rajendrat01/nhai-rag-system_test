Further, as per para 2.6 of Policy dated 19.04.2022, \"On Force Majeure Cost, RO will submit their recommendation to Technical Division. Technical Division will obtain the Finance Concurrence and will seek approval of Chairman\" 3 In the matter, National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF) has represented that the Concessionaires are constantly struggling with their cashflows due to such intermittent forceful closure of Toll Plazas and requested for compensating the Concessionaire/ Toll Operator on real- time basis. Further, the provision for immediate release of 75% of the claim is not being followed due to lack of clarity regarding Delegation of Powers in this regard. 4_ It is now decided that the delegation of power for release of 75% of Claim Amount to the BOT (Toll) Concessionaires within 30 days from receipt of Claims be assigned to RO concerned: Accordingly, para 7 of policy dated 02.07.2021 is modified as under: 75% of eligible claim amount may be paid to the BOT   (Toll) Concessionaires within 30 days from receipt of Claims after verifying the details, with the approval of RO concerned, SO as to keep reconciliation margin. However, the procedure for release of Compensation towards Final Force Majeure Cost (after appropriate adjustments) shall continue to be governed as per para 2.6 of Policy dated 19.04.2022. 5_ This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. 22| (CS.
