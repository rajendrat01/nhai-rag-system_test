Sector-10, Dwarka, New Delhi-110075 No. 11041/218/2007- Admn. Dated: 3.03.2010 POLICY MATTERS TECHNICAL(53/2010) [Decision taken on TIC division'$ file No. NHAI/Tech/ I/Gen I/ 2009] Sub:: Use of Double Barrel Drum Mix Plant Manual for construction and supervision of bituminous works issued by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways specifies the various advantages of double barrel drum mix plants. 2. The double barrel drum mix plants have two coaxial drums; The aggregate is dried and heated in the inner drum and thereafter material comes out to the outer surface of the inner drum which has paddles and acts as pug mill for mixing of the bitumen and hot aggregate, thus mixing them in outer drum. The entire process of such drum mix plants gives a very homogeneous mix, 3. Double Barrel Drum Mix Plants are also suitable in case of using Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) and are cost and energy efficient systems. These plants are environment friendly due to low emission of carbon gases: 4 , Annexure A of IRC:27-2009 specifies the essential features of Hot Mix Plants. Double barrel drum mix plants which are satisfying the requirements as per IRC:27 may be used in NHAI Projects with the caution to have greater control and frequent check at production site for ensuring proper gradation in the bituminous mix and thoroughness of the mix. 5 , This issue with the approval of Chairman: ,|1e .
