Introduction : \n1.1 One of the core objectives of the MGNREGS is, “Providing not less than one \nhundred days of unskilled manual work as a guaranteed employment in a financial \nyear to every household in rural areas as per demand, resulting in creation of \nproductive assets of prescribed quality and durability” and Strengthening the \nlivelihood resource base of the poor”.  \n1.2 The works related to dr ought proofing including afforestation and tree p lanting  \nare permissible works as per  Schedule -I-para-4(I),I.(v)“Afforestation, tree \nplantation and horticulture in common and forest lands, road margins, canal \nbunds, tank foreshores and coastal belts duly providing right to usufruct to the \nhouseholds covered in paragraph 5 ”. Tree is the only asset which grows produci ng \nsustainable income to the household every year. Hence the importance to the tree \nplanting in MGNREGA.  \n2. Plantation on Road Margins:  \n2.1 There are a number of roads i.e., national, state highways, PMGSY and other \nrural roads, where road side plantation is being done, but because of limitation of \nfunds for plantatio n and maintenance of plantation under the respective schemes, \nmost of the roads cannot be covered under plantation.  \n2.2 Road side plantation will not only create productive asset s but will also check \nthe deterioration of roads and will contribute to strengthen ecological balance and \nreducing global warming.  \n2.3 To start with ,it is proposed to go for road side plantation s on PMGSY and \nNational Highway roads under MGNREGA in a system atic and plann ed way.  \n3. Objectives :  \ni. To provide sustainable , productive and green assets for livelihood of \nthe rural poor.   \nii. To p romote ecological balance by promoting soil/water conservation  \nworks alongwith tree plantation s.  \n \n4.Identification of PMGSY Roads:  \n \n4.1. PMGSY roads for taking up the plantation work are to be identified by \nPMGSY field officers in consultation with the Gram Panchayat/Zilla Panchayat \nand MGNREGA officers (through routes and link routes with adequate land \nbeyond the road shoulder , to be identified).  \n  \n \n2  \n A Plan of Action for Roadside Tree Plantation under MGNREGA  \n  \n4.2. Transect walk (for deciding the location, area of plantation and preparing a \ntentative sketch indicating plantation area and no plantation area) to be undertaken \ninvolving Pradhan /Sarpanch/ Members of Gram Panchayat as well as Gram \nRozgarSeva k. During Transect Walk , all the details will be recorded.  \n \n4.3. Avenue plantation can be done along the road (beyond the road shoulder) and \nblock plantation can be done wherever Government land is  available adjacent to \nthe road and without any prejudice to safety aspect of the road.  \n \nIdentification of National Highways  \n \n4.4. The National Highways will be identified by the NHAI. The roadside \nplantation under this plan on National Highways shall be implemented in \nconvergence with NHAI, where the material component of the estimate would be \ncontributed by NHAI by depositing the same with the State Employment \nGuarantee Fund  under MGNREGA .  \n \n5. Identification of Beneficiaries:  \n \n5.1. The Gram Panchayat, in consultation with the revenue authorities would \ndecide the stretches of roads/canals for undertaking the plantation work under this \nprogramme.  \n \n5.2 Before execution of plant ation work, the beneficiaries shall be identified and \nprior itised from the households belonging to categories as in Para 5 of Schedule -I \nof the MGNREGA  in the villages falling on the side of roads. Among these \nbeneficiaries, the first priority will be given to those whose land is falling by the \nside of the road.  \n \n5.3. The identified beneficiaries along with the proposed lands shall be placed in \nthe Gram Sabha as per MGNREGS guidelines for approval.  \n \n5.4. On approval of Gram Sabha, Gram Panchayat shall file, an application on \nbehalf of the identified beneficiaries (Proforma in Format I -enclosed ) before the \ndesignated authority responsible for protection of such Government land seeking \npermission to plant under the scheme duly specifying: the areas for plantation, \nname of the beneficiary, species proposed to be planted.  \n \n5.5. Permission:  \ni. The designated authority, on receipt of application in Format I, shall \nconsider the same and decide whether to give permission or not.  \nii. Permission for plantation shall be refused if such plantation (a) could \nthreaten the public safety or (b) land is unavailable or under dispute \nor (c) land is required for departmental use in the near future.   \n \n3  \n A Plan of Action for Roadside Tree Plantation under MGNREGA  \n  \niii. All cases of rejection for plantation can be ap pealed to an higher \nauthority, who shall have the power to over -rule the rejection made \nand could grant permission.   \niv. Permission granted shall be in Format II (enclosed) which shall \ncontain granting of usufruct rights on the trees planted which shall be \nheritable but not alienable.  \nv. Each beneficiary shall be allotted land strips for planting not more \nthan 200 trees.  \nvi. Permission granted can be revoked by a higher a uthority based on the \nreport of the Programme Officer of MGNREGS and the designated \nauthority f or protection of the land if the beneficiary has: (a) not \nperformed his obligations as per the scheme (b) damaged or has \nattempt ed to damage the land (c) encroached lands of nearby far mers \nor (d) has done or attempted  to do any illegal act on the land.  \n \n6. Usufruct sor the Tree Patta s: \n \nThe identified beneficiaries of the scheme will have heritable but inalienable right \nover the usufruct s of the trees allotted to them , but they will have no right on the \nland covered by t he trees. This right is subject to the beneficiary performing  \na. All operations for raising, protecting, waterin g the trees as per the \nestimate/schedule  with the members of his household .  \nb. Shall reap the usufruct s of the trees after they are mature without damaging \nthe trees or the public assets; and if removal of the plant is essential, shall do \nreplantation at his cost with proper consultation.  \nc. Shall not encroach on other lands, not allotted to him.  \nd. Shall not do  or attempt to do any activity that would damage the land \nallotted . \ne. Shall not use the land for doing any act prohibited under l aw. \n \n7. Identification of Plant Species:  \n \n7.1 The selection of tree species to be done in by the community in consultation \nwith the local Gram Panchayat and Forest and Horticulture Departments, \nconsidering the suitability and availability of plants for arid and dry region, moist \nareas, marshy areas, saline areas etc. as recommended in IRC SP 21: 2009.  \n \n7.2 For conducting Plantation activities, p lant material can be procured by Gram \nPanchayat from Government Nurseries or Forest department in the first year \n(2014 -15). In the subsequent years (2015 -16) self-help groups may raise nurseries \nand provide the plants.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n4  \n A Plan of Action for Roadside Tree Plantation under MGNREGA  \n  \n8.
