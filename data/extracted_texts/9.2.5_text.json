In some cases the Engineer apparently did not exercise adequate vigil to fulfil their contractual obligations by taking timely action for violation cn the part of the contractor. Unauthorized sub-contracting undoubtedly calls for a deterrent action against the contractor as well as the Engineer as such contracting not only violates the contractual provisions but also affects adversely the overall quality of the project. Project Directors of PIUs CMUs SPVs are therefore requested to bring this matter to the attention of the Contractors/Engineers in their respective jurisdictions and discuss with them the steps to be taken to ensure that there is no violation of contract provision in this regard. such contravention may also be brought to the notice of the NHAI Headquarters immediately: This issues with approval of the Competent Authority. 2 | X (V.K.
