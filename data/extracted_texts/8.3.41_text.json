In some cases, COS/RIS proposals were returned by NHAI officers to AE/IE/SC for getting further details and thereafter these were neither pursued nor closed. In many cases, this situation has been used as a strategy to cover up the delays in construction by the Contractor. In other cases, COS works had already been taken up thereby making in-principle approval a mere formality, which is blatant violation of instructions. Another   practice by NHAI officers is to ask for  undertakings from Contractor for no claims on COS, despite knowing very well that such undertakings have not much meaning and have been considered as 'given under duress' in several Arbitral Awards / Court Orders. 3 Henceforth, if COS/RIS proposal is not submitted within 6 months from the Appointed Date, justification on why action should not be taken against AE/IEISC & NHAI Officers should be given. COS/RIS proposals beyond 6 months of Appointed Date will be allowed in very rare cases, after seeing the justification why it could not be recommended within the  stipulated   period and how fast it was  processed after identifying the requirement at site: Also, such belated COS works may be taken up through a separate bid or if separate bid is not feasible; COS may have to be taken out of completion requirement so that Contractors do not quote this as reason and cover up their own delays in completion of other reaches/ works or claim prolongation costs: If processing of COS/ RIS is delayed without proper justification, an appropriate entry in APARs will be made against concerned officer(s) of NHAI: 4 _ In case the Contractor is not furnishing the details required for approval of COS, AE/IEISC will prepare & submit such details for which a reasonable cost of services will be paid to AE/IE/SC at the cost of Contractor.
