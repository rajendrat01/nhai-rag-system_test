In access controlled/ partially access controlled project highways, VUPs/ Flyovers/ Overpasses along with Entry Exit Ramps/ Slips Roads/ Service Roads are being proposed to cater for the traffic on the crossroads. These structures will also be used by the traffic crossing over from one side to the other side of the project highway. It has been observed that when such crossover traffic is   high, in particular _ traffic taking U-turn at the structure, there is a need to provide additional spans for VUP / Flyover / Overpass to cater for traffic taking U-turn. These additional spans have already been prescribed in the Manuals of IRC (Ref. fig 3.12 in SP-84 & Fig: 3.5 in SP-87) 2 In view of above, it has been decided that in future projects, whenever a flyover / overpass is proposed with a service road of 10 m (Zm black 2x1.Sm shoulders) , a minimum of 3 spans for such flyover/ overpass should be provided with a minimum lateral clearance of 25m for main span and 15m for viaduct span on either side (Total= 55m) SO as to facilitate U' turn of traffic. The vertical clearance of viaduct span may be kept in   longitudinal slope/ gradient of approaches: 3_ The approaches to structures viz PUP , VUP , Flyover , Overpass, Bridges, ROBs etc. should be on earthen embankment wherever RoW is available or land is not  costly to acquire. In case of restricted RoW / Costly lands and in order to accommodate entry-exit ramp/ slip road/ service road within the available Row first the option of earthen embankment with RCC toe wall and slope protection may be explored: If it is not feasible, then only approaches with RCC Retaining Wall (upto 2.5m height W.r.t floor height of structure, as it is cheaper to RE wall for low heights) and RE Wall (for heights more than 2.5m) be used. If further RoW is not to be acquired for approaches due to high land cost, the same should be justified by comparing the cost of land with cost of RCC toe or retaining wall/RE wall. 4. The service road level shall be kept same as adjoining fields/ ground level in order to maintain its accessibility and deck levels of cross drainage works/ bridges on service road shall also be kept at same level. 5_ The project highway shall be carried at the existing level in the rural areas, where there is no habitation and the cross road will be either  underpass or overpass. However, in urban/ habitation areas, the cross road shall be carried at the existing level. The decision whether the cross road or the project highway is to be carried at the existing level shall be taken based on considerations of land NHAI 5 April, top may",
