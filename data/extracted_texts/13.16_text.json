In view of consumption of a substantial quantity of natural materials in road construction, depleting natural resources and disposal problem of deteriorated pavement material & simultaneously to ensure conservation of energy, preservation of environment and reduction in construction cost, National Highways Authority of India vide its Circular No_ 11041/218/2007-Admn dated 24.02.2010 (Policy Matter: Technical 48/2010 dated 24.02.2010) has  encouraged Use of recycled existing bituminous material to upgrade an existing bituminous pavement in NHAI Projects 2 Presently, majority of projects being implemented by NHAI are on BOT mode wherein flexibility is given to the Concessionaire for adoption of new technologies in design, construction and materials. In future, public funded projects are planned to be implemented on EPC mode, wherein same flexibility for adoption of new/innovative technologies shall be available to the contractors. It is recommended that newlinnovative technologies Using reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) materials may be  encouraged due to the  following important facts & advantages associated with the use of reclaimed asphalt pavement materials in road construction as well as maintenance: a) Untreated RAP material may be Used aS a substitute for conventional material to construct a new pavement layer provided it is derived from good quality aggregates: b) As RAP is a valuable material it should not be squandered by Using it where such quality is not warranted, It may be used aS substituteltreated where necessary) where, conventional pavement materials are expensive andlor scarce. When treated with suitable additive bitumen, RAP can be used as a premium material to construct the upper layers of pavements that carry heavy loads. The use of RAP up to 30% in bituminous mixes is a practice in many countries abroad. The study done by the National Center for Asphalt Technology at Auburn University, USA has indicated that 30 percent RAP in an asphalt pavement can provide the same overall performance as virgin asphalt pavement; RAP containing bitumen more than 59 and penetration of bitumen more than 30 may be used in bituminous works provided the bitumen in the RAP is rejuvenated by suitable additivelsoft bitumen and designed scientifically. Since the grading of aggregate in RAP is also important to decide quantity of RAP in the final mix it is, therefore, necessary to NHAL May, using",
