In some cases, even PDs allowed the start of COS work at site. Already, NHAI has been constrained to issue warnings to RO/PD concerned for delays in taking in-principle approvals: Henceforth, PD, RO & Tech: Divisions at HQ shall submit the proposals for in- principle approval of COS/RIS to the Competent Authority within 30 days of identification of requirement of such COS/RIS at site: (ii) Vide Policy Guidelines dated 21.08.2017_ ROs had been delegated powers for issuing COS/RIS Order for cases where in-principle approvals had been granted by the Competent Authority: Instances have come to the notice, wherein in- principle approved cost of COS varied beyond 5%, thereby requiring revised approval of cost of COS from HQ: In fact, it should not have happened in the normal course, if all components of works were identified properly. However, considering that the detailed designs/ costs are finalized only after in- principle approval, such eventuality cannot be ruled out. This has been examined and the following guidelines are issued: (a) While submitting the proposals for in-principle approval of COS/RIS, PDs & ROs should ensure that the estimates are realistic to the extent feasible. Towards this, the quantities shall be based on detailed designs and rates shall be taken from the applicable SOR duly taking cognizance of the provisions in the Concession/ Contract Agreement, (b) Once in-principle approval is conveyed by the competent   authority, COS/RIS order shall be issued by the Regional Officer within 10 (c) Though revision of in-principle   approved cost of COS/RIS should not happen, but if necessitated, due to justifiable reasons, the Competent H1 RTMHI NHAL New days.",
