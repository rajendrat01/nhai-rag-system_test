No. 5893) Sub: Provision of Vehicular Underpass/ Flyover. In continuation of the Policy Guidelines no. 10.1.18/2019 dated 30.04.2019, with a view to provide a better facility to the road users, safer roads and to cater to the requirements of future traffic on the cross roads, it is decided as under: Life of these structures is 60 years  The traffic projections for the next 15-20 years should be kept in mind while designing VUPs/ Flyovers, particularly in semi-urban areas where expansion of town is imminent:. (ii) At all locations of built-up areas and in semi-urban areas where high traffic growth is projected in the time to come, a minimum of 3 spans for vehicular underpass should be provided with a minimum lateral clearance of 30 m for the main span & 15 m for the viaduct spans on either side. (iii) At locations other than (ii) above, single span underpass shall be provided with minimum lateral clearance of 12-15 m which includes 1.5-2.5 m raised footpath for pedestrians on either side (iv) At such   single span   underpasses, suitable traffic  calming measures viz. road  signs, markings, etc; shall be installed as per IRC:99 provisions. Further, the section of cross road below the main span of all VUPs and theentry service road in either direction shall be provided with paver block/ cut stone pavement for a distance of 60-90 m from the junction for enforcing speed restrictions. The indicative drawings (2 No.) are enclosed. For providing better line of sight, the visibility between the traffic plying on the cross road and the traffic on slip road shall be improved at the junction of RE wall and the structure by adopting suitable measures such as chamfering / beveling, tapering, provision of gap slab etc. as indicated in the enclosed drawings and the structure be designed accordingly:` Further, the lateral clearance between the outer face of the structure & the inner of the servicel slip road on either side shall be maintained between 1.5m to 4.5m at the point of approaching the crossroad, depending on the ROW available, as indicated in the enclosed drawings. (vi) In order to avoid crisscrossing of pedestrians on divided highways especially at start & end of approaches to the structures, New Jersey Type Concrete Crash Barriers (NJB) or Steel Railing with a height of 1.2m (to make it unclimbable) shall be provided for a minimum length of SOm so as to discourage such crisscrossing and avoid accidents. NJB may be provided where cutting of railing/ theft/ vandalism is expected, otherwise steel railing may be provided for better aesthetics and to avoid blinding effect. If pedestrian cross traffic is high at such locations, even FOBs shall be planned. I(Yg. Contd: P/2 #T 7 U M NHAI edge",
