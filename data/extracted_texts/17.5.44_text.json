It reflects that Projecl Directors are not concentrating on revenue collection activities seriously . There are some instances in notice regarding complaints of duplicate tickels as well as manipulation in server . These may be the root cause of decline in user fee collection revenue. Individual letters are issued where decline in toll revenue is consiclerably high for which responsibility of Project Directors may also be (ixed , Under the circumstances stated above Project Directors are again directed to make sure that in no case revenue collection should decline without proper  justification. Since the quantum of traffic is   increasing about 10% collection must also improve by about 10% regularly . It is also intirnated that in case Ihey fail to stop pilferage manipulalions & in stepping up collections as stated above , the matter  will be viewed very  seriously and adverse enlries in ACR may also be recorded.
