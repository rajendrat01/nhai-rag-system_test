To ensure effective implementation of this provision, a comprehensive Web Based mechanism has been developed. This enableg not only the Concessionaire to locate and monitor its own vehicles but also enables other stakeholder to monitor deployment and usage of such vehicles such as by the PIUsl CMUs/ ROs and designated officers of NHAI Installation of this system is now at an advance stage across all PIUg based on the input received from the concerned ROs, 2 It has been decided by the Competent Authority that henceforth all the Ambulances, Route Patrol Vehicles and Tow-Away Cranes deployed by the Concessionaires under BOT and OMT contracts  shall be installed with this Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) with Global Positioning System (GPS) facility. While the cost shall be borne by the respective Concessionaire as per the contracted rates (Annex-A), following will be the alternatives in this regard for the existing Concession Agreements: Where the   Concessionaire has not   installed GPS devices in their   vehicles (Ambulances, Route Patrol Vehicles and Tow  Away Cranes) The service provider employed by NHAI (Mls. KPIT Technologies Ltd) can be directed to install GPS devices in all such vehicles and charge appropriate rate as approved by NHAI. (ii) Where the Concessionaire has already installed GPS devices in their vehicles (Ambulances, Route Patrol Vehicles and Tow Away Cranes), the Concessionaire will be asked to integrate the GPS devices installed in their vehicles in consultation with the service provider employed by NHAI (iii) Where the Concessionaire has already installed GPS devices in their vehicles (Ambulances, Route Patrol Vehicles and Tow Away Cranes) , however; it is not technically possible to integrate those devices with the Vehicle Tracking System developed by NHAI, the Concessionaire will be asked to replace the GPS devices installed in their vehicles with the help of the service provider employed by NHAI: 7I ?7 _ NHAL Away Hq: got",
