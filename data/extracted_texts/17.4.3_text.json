NHAICOMMERCIAL OPERATIONI58 Sub: Experience for collection of user fee through Private Contractors model bid document for collection of user fee through private contractors has been circulated vide our- Circular No. NHAICommercial  Operation/48 dated 20.10.2004_ Queries have been received from various Project Directors, whether minimum required turnover of the bidders should be in the field of toll  collection or any business. It has been felt that there may be only a few parties with experience in toll collection and thus, criteria of experience only in toll collection will restrict : competition: On the other hand, criteria of tumover as prescribed will itself ensure that only established business entities can compete. As such, turnover of the bidder need not be in any particular field of business: Accordingly it has been decided that no change is required in the model bid document and the turnover prescribed could be in any field of business. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. (MM Lohia) General Manager (CO) AII PIU'sICMU's NHAI Copy to: 1_ All Members 2. All CGMsICVO 3.
