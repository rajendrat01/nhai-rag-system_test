No. 57441) Sub: SOP for rates of Network Survey Vehicle (NSV) Survey till empanelment of agencies. Carrying out the road condition survey using Network Survey Vehicle (NSV) on the National Highways has been made mandatory at the time of certifying completion of the project and also every Six months thereafter. This provision is now part of the Standard RFP Documents of Consultancy Services for AE/ IE/ Supervision Consultant: 2 However , it has been observed that some consultancy contracts which were finalized to 2017 based on old RFP documents do not have this provision. MoRT&H has also emphasized vide their Policy on the subject dated 13.11.2019 (Ref. Para-5) that the condition of the roads has to be assessed using NSV in respect of contracts where provision for use of NSV does not exist and the rates for NSV survey are to be decided by the Project- in-Charge. 3 It is intimated that action for empanelment of agencies for NSV survey is being taken by IT Division at HQ, which may take a few weeks. Further, the rates of NSV survey are available in the existing consultancy contracts with the ROs (where NSV survey is specified in RFP) and the rates finalized through quotations in compliance of MoRT&H Policy Guidelines mentioned above may also be available with some ROs. Therefore, the ROs may carry out due diligence of the available rates in their region and decide the ratel agency to meet the immediate need of NSV survey within their region. 5 After finalization of the agencies by IT Division at HQ, the work of NSV survey shall be carried out through such agencies on the terms & conditions s0 finalized by the IT Division. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. (Sheo Shankar Jha) CGM (Coord:) To All officers of NHAI HQ/ROs/PIUs/CMUs/Site Offices Copy to: 1_ PS to Chairman 2. PS to All Members/CVo 3.
