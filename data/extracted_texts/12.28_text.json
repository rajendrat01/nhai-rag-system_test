The process for selection of consultants should\navoid both actual and perceived conflict of interest.\n3.         Conflict  of  interest  may  arise  between  the  Authority  and  a\nconsultant or between consultants and present or future concessionaries/\ncontractors. Some of the situations that would involve conflict of interest\nare identified below:(a) Authority and consultants:\n(i) Potential consultant should not be privy to information from the\nAuthority which is not available to others; or \n(ii)  Potential  consultant  should  not  have  defined  the  project  when\nearlier working for the Authority; or\n(iii)  Potential  consultant  should  not  have  recently  worked  for  the\nAuthority overseeing the project.\n(b) Consultants and concessionaires/contractors:\n(i) No consultant should have an ownership interest or a continuing\nbusiness  interest  or  an  on-going  relationship  with  a  potential\nconcessionaire/contractor save and except relationships restricted to\nproject-specific and short-term assignments; or\n(ii) No consultant should be involved in owning or operating entities\nresulting from the project; or \n(iii) No consultant should bid for works arising from the project.\nThe participation of companies that may be involved as investors or consumers\nand officials of the Authority who have current or recent connections to the\ncompanies involved, therefore, needs to be avoided.\n4.  The normal way to identify conflicts of interest is through self-declaration\nby  consultants.  Where  a  conflict  exists,  which  has  not  been  declared,\ncompeting companies are likely to bring this to the notice of the Authority. All\nconflicts must be declared as and when the consultants become aware of\nthem.\n5.   Another approach towards avoiding a conflict of interest is through the\nuse of “Chinese walls” to avoid the flow of commercially sensitive information\nfrom  one  part  of  the  consultant’s  company  to  another.  This  could  help\novercome the problem of availability of limited numbers of experts for the\nproject. However, in reality effective operation of “Chinese walls” may be a\ndifficult proposition. As a general rule, larger companies will be more capable\nof  adopting  Chinese  walls  approach  than  smaller  companies.  Although,\n“Chinese walls” have been relatively common for many years, they are an\nincreasingly discredited means of avoiding conflicts of interest and should be\nconsidered with caution. As a rule, “Chinese walls” should be considered as\nunacceptable  and  may  be  accepted  only  in  exceptional  cases  upon  full\ndisclosure  by  a  consultant  coupled  with  provision  of  safeguards  to  the\nsatisfaction of the Authority.\n6.  Another  way  to  avoid  conflicts  of  interest  is  through  the  appropriate\ngrouping of tasks. For example, conflicts may arise if consultants drawing up\nthe terms of reference or the proposed documentation are also eligible for the\nconsequent assignment or project. \n7.   Another form of conflict  of interest called “scope–creep” arises  when\nconsultants  advocate  either  an  unnecessary  broadening  of  the  terms  ofreference or make recommendations which are not in the best interests of the\nAuthority but which will generate further work for the consultants. Some forms\nof  contractual  arrangements  are  more  likely  to  lead  to  scope-creep.  For\nexample, lump-sum contracts provide fewer incentives for this, while time and\nmaterial contracts provide built in incentives for consultants to extend the\nlength of their assignment.\n8.  Every project contains potential conflicts of interest. Consultants should not\nonly avoid any conflict of interest, they should report any present/ potential\nconflict  of interest  to the Authority at  the earliest.  Officials of the Authority\ninvolved in development of a project shall be responsible for identifying and\nresolving any conflicts of interest. It should be ensured that safeguards are in\nplace to preserve fair and open competition and measures should be taken to\neliminate any conflict of interest arising at any stage in the process.\n Schedule-IV\n(See clause 2.3)\n \nNo Conflict of Interest Certificate\n                                                                                \n \nAssignment of Safety Consultant - \n \nName of Project :   \n \nName of Concessionaire/Contractor: \n \nName of Independent Engineer (IE)/ Authority’s Engineer (AE)/DPR Consultant  :\n \nOn behalf of our  firm/organization and the proposed team  members  for the\nassignment of Safety Consultant for above mentioned project, we certify that \ni.We have no financial interest in any of the above mentioned entities or in \nthe contracts of the Concessionaire/ Contractor  and IE/AE of above \nmentioned project.  \nii.We have had no previous employment by or financial ties to any of above \nmentioned entities except for the following fee based consultancy services.\n \nS.

This\nsection of highway commences in a flat area of rural land and is\nbasically straight and flat for the first half until it reaches a wooded\nhill area for the second 28km. An 80km/h design speed has been\nused for the flat section and a 60km/h design speed has been used\nin the hill section. The highway passes through two towns and eight\nvillages.  Ten new  bus  lay-bys  are  included  in  the  proposal.  No\nchange is proposed to the six existing bridges.

Unpaved  shoulders\ndiscourage vulnerable road users from\nwalking/riding  on  them  as  shown  in\npicture (especially during the monsoon\nperiod).  They  become  damaged  when\nheavy vehicles drive on them. This can\nlead  to  deep  drop-offs  from  the\npavement  which  in  turn  becomes  a\nhazard  for  small  vehicles.  There  are\nmany  pedestrians,  bicyclists  and\nmotorcyclists using this highway.
