It is mainly to avoid delays in handing over the sites t the contractors. It is contemplaled that if such land are acquired through NH Act;, it will cause further delay in handling over the sites t the contractors Moreover , this   may also result into contractual claims by the contractors_ As generally the case , the land acquisition  through the NH Act is time consuming; therefore; it is felt that land acquisition of these missingladditional plots through consent would be helpful in several ways to achieve the goals as follows: (a) The land could be taken in possession immediately for  implementing the scheme. b Inherent delays noticed in the acquisition of land could be avoided. (c) The expenditure incurred on publication of notifications under Section 3a), 3A) and 3(d) in the local newspapers is saved.
