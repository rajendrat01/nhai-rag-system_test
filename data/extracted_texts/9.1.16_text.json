No. 149957)) Sub: List of Provisionally Qualified Bidders for HAM Projects to avoid repetitive examination of biding documents by Technical Divisions reg: A Bidder normally submits bids for civil works for different projects. The Technical Capacity & Financial Capacity of the same bidder is being assessed for each project by Technical Divisions which consumes a lot of energy and time. 2 _ In order to avoid repetitive examination of bids, the pre-qualification done in case of HAM projects for which bids were received, during the period from 01.10.2022 to 30.09.2023, have been taken into consideration_ The relevant documents were obtained from the concerned Financial Consultants. 3_ Accordingly, lists of provisionally technically qualified bidders for HAM Projects have been prepared and the same are attached at List A and List B with following details: The List A contains Technical Capacity (EPC) upto which a bidder is eligible on the basis of assessment made earlier by Technical Divisions for the bids received   during the period from 01.07.2023 to 30.09.2023 (containing technical score of last five years starting from 2018-19 to 2022-23) (ii) The list B contains Technical Capacity (EPC) upto which a bidder is eligible on the basis of assessment made earlier by Technical Divisions for the bids received   during the   period from 01.10.2022 to 30.06.2023 (containing technical score of last five years starting from 2017-18 to 2021-22). As per Clause 2.2.2, technical capacity is   determined for the last five years, therefore for determining technical score for the current year 2023-24, the technical score of 2017-18 has been excluded. (iii) A particular bidder is eligible for the EPC mentioned against its respective name. However if there is specific span/ special eligibility requirement in the project under bidding; the same needs to be evaluated from the bid received: (iv) Both the lists shall remain valid upto 30.06.2024. 4 In view of above_ to hasten the process of evaluation, Technical Division may assess the bids without referring to Annex-II; IIl & IV of Appendix-IA of RFP for HAM Projects for the bidders mentioned in List A (Part I) and without referring to Annex II & IV of Appendix- IA of RFP for HAM Projects for the bidders mentioned at list A (Part II) and list B, if the Estimated Project Cost of the subject project is less than or equal to the Estimated Project Cost declared in the list of Provisionally Qualified Bidders, and for rest of the criterion, bids shall be assessed by the Technical Divisions as per requirement of the RFP _ Contd_2I - H ?t 7 91 NHAL",
