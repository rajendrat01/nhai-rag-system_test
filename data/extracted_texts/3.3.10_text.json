It has been   observed that in number of cases the repatriation orders of the Project Director or other joint signatory of the Bank Account are issued by HQ with the approval of the Competent Authority but these orders are not being implemented by the ROs/PDs and such officers continue to be the signatory of the Bank Account of the RO /PIU. 2 It has therefore been decided that: (i} In the case of repatriation of  either of the PD or other joint signatory of Bank Account i.e_ Finance Officers or Manager (T)}; the authority to sign the cheques of such repatriated officers shall stand withdrawn immediately on issue of such repatriation order by the HQ without waiting for his/her formal relief from NHAI, (ii) In the case of repatriation of PD, the new PD who is appointed /or given additional charge of the PIU shall become the joint signatory with the finance officer; the finance officer being the DDO In case of repatriation of Finance Officer, the senior most Manager (T) of the PIU shall become joint signatory with PD; PD being the DDO. In the cases where PD alone is   posted without any Finance Officer /Manager (T) and if a JAO is in place in that PIU, the JAO will function as joint signatory and PD will be the DDO 3_ This may strictly be complied with by the ROs/ Project Directors. 4_ This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority.
