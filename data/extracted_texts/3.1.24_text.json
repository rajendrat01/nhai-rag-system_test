EPC as well as HAM agreements contain provisions for payment of mobilisation advance not excedding 10% of the contract price (in EPC)/ Bid Project Cost (in HAM): The above advance is released on furnishing Of an irrevocable and unconditional Bank Guarantee (BG) equal to an amount of 110% of such advance as security. BGs shall remain effective till the complete and full repayment of the Mobilsation Advance. 2_ The Contract / Concession agreement is silent about part release of BGs on recovery of part advance. The Authority has received requests from the Contractors/ Concessionaires for release of part BGs submitted by  them, to the extent of   repayment/recovery of equivalent amount of mobilisation advance. 3 The matter was discussed in the Executive Committee (EC): Observing that the requests from the Contractors/ Concessionaires have merit, it has been decided that: As the advances get recovered from the running bills/ stage payments, the BG for the amount equivalent to the amount of advance recovered may be released on the request of the Contractor/ Concessionaire. (ii) The Contractor / Concessionaire would be at liberty to either submit substitute BG for the residual amount or multiple BGs for such residual amount in replacement of the existing BG. 4 It has been further decided that while these guidelines apply to the already executed existing Contracts/ Concession Agreements, the above provision may also be incorporated in the future bidding documents of EPC/HAM: This issues with the approval of the Chairman.
