Presently, there are 144 references before the Courts on contractual disputes/ claims   involving a total claim amount of nearly Rs. 5,700   Crore. Further , 132 references have been made to various Arbitral Tribunals entailing a total claim amount of Rs. 38,000 Crore. Thus the problem of pending disputes and claims has assumed serious   proportions: The   associated legal costs and diversion of manpower of both parties are enormous. The early resolution/ settlement of claims, preferably through an out-of-court settlement process, is in the interest of all the stakeholders. 2_ Background: 2.1 An alternate   dispute resolution mechanism was established in the NHAI vide office order dated 03.12.2012 of the Contract Management Cell (CMC), with the approval of NHAI Board in its   meeting held on 09.11.2012, for one-time settlement of pending claims in the item rate contracts. Further, as approved by the NHAI Board in its meeting held on 05.04.2016, the settlement mechanism was extended to other forms of contracts [BOT(Toll)/ BOT(Annuity) / OMT/ Hybrid- Annuity/ O&M/ Toll, etc] as well. This mechanism involves three steps: viz. initial negotiations by a 3-CGM Committee, (ii) recommendations of the Independent Settlement  Advisory Committee (ISAC), and  (iii) approval of the Executive Committee (EC)/ Board of NHAI. 2.2 As decided by the Board of NHAI in its meeting held on 16.02.2015, the Executive Committee (EC) was authorised to decide cases involving settlement up to Rs.
