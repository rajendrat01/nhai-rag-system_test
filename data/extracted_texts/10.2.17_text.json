It has been observed that the experience certificates are being issued to the Consulting Firms deployed for above services by the concerned ROsIPDs without proper verification of the ownership and experience. It has also come to the notice that the credentials are being issued to the Consulting Firms on the basis of supervision of equipment usage; Whereas, work actually would have been performed by a third party: It is also a concern that experience certificates are issued by NHAI officials in non-standard format These kinds of experience certificates are leading to anomalies and creating issues in evaluation of RFPs at various levels. 2 It is to further inform that complaints are being received quite frequently about fraudulent certificates on usage of equipment by the various Consulting Firms highlighting the issues of not having specified equipment;, ownership and experience in its actual usage In this regard; it may be clarified that the experience of the Firm shall be recognized only when the Firm has actually performed the above activities through its own staff directly, to avoid duplicity in claiming of the experience. 3 It therefore, required that a standard format as enclosed in Annex-I is adopted by all the officers  concerned who issue the experience certificate to Consulting Firms after due verification and certification: 4_ Further, it is to inform that SRD&Q Division vide letter no. NHAIITICINew ~Tech/2018 dated 20t August'18 and 9th November'18, followed by several reminders had requested all ROs to provide information on use of technology by the Consulting Firms. However, details have been furnished only for 874 km of use of technology in consultancy assignments on NHAI projects. On the contrary, the experience certificates issued by NHAI officials (PDs) indicate wide spread use of such technologies in various projects carried out by the Consulting Firms. Therefore; there appears to be doubt over the credentials of the firms, who are submitting such certificates and on the Issuing Authority. 5 , In view of  above; all GMs/ROsIPDs are directed to   re-examine the   experience certificates issued by NHAI and same shall be considered in evaluation of RFPs only after due verification by the respective Technical Divisions and ROs. In case the credentials are found to be false or fraudulent; the action against the Firm and the Issuing Authority may be taken. (Continued) (4T PT RT 4T} NHAL is,",
