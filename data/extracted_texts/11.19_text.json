Although the contract /concession agreements provide for legal status of these supplementary agreements, contractors/concessionaires have challenged it before Arbitration/court of law and obtained relief on the grounds of allegedly Signed under Duress While the main reasons of failures has been observed as poor legal drafting and insertion of unnecessary waivers, the other reason has been where the content & contentions of Supplementary Agreements have not been properly explained/ presented before Arbitration/court of law and thus led to rejections citing signed under duress. 2) It has been observed that in some of Arbitration cases, cases before Hon'ble High Court or lower courts, that the grounds of Signed under Duress were agreed and Supplementary Agreements declared void. However _ it has also been observed that Hon'ble Supreme Court has upheld the legal validity of Supplementary Agreements signed between the parties, if signed with due diligence of the parties in the manner specified in main agreement: 3) It has been held by the Courts in India that settlement/supplementary agreements are entered into between the parties with consent from both sides thus, held to be valid and legally binding: However, if either of the parties to the aforesaid settlement/supplementary agreements alleges to have entered into the same under duress/coercion exerted by the opposite party, the said assertion needs to be supported with sufficient evidence, in the absence of which such claim will be rejected by the Courts and the settlement/supplementary agreements will be held to be valid and binding: Few of the Hon'ble Court citations are as given below: i) Hon'ble Supreme Court Judgement in the matter of Gagandeep Pratisthan (P) Ltd & Ors.
