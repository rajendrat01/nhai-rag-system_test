This situation leads to either delay in starting of toll collection or starting with inadequate infrastructure Separate tenders have to be called for toll plazas and widening of lanes for this purpose, which is a cumbersome process. It is necessary therefore that  there should be advanced planning for construction of toll plazas. Toll plaza includes an administrative building; toll booths and additional lanes_ Following circulars/guidelines have already been issued regarding the construction of a toll plaza, requirement of space for server room, toll booth, electrical fixtures and other related matter.
