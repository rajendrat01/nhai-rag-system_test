It was reiterated vide Circular No. NHAI/CMC/ Misc. /2016/98885 dated 26.04.2017 (copy enclosed at Annex-A) that NHAI had no policy for engagement of the Financial Consultants for evaluating the Technical & Financial bids of the Authority Engineers, Independent Engineers and other consultants. Accordingly, it was decided that such proposals be evaluated by the concerned Division/ Committee of NHAI. However, due to shortage of manpower and with the approval of concerned Member, some Technical Divisions had engaged the Financial Consultants for evaluating such Consultancy Bids, but the payments of many of the Financial Consultants are pending for want of approval from the Competent Authority. 2 Based on the representation of a Financial Consultant, it was decided by the Competent Authority that so as the Financial Consultants were engaged till 27.08.2019 (date of approval of Competent Authority) with the approval of Member Concerned, the bills may be accepted and payments be made for the services obtained: The other provisions of circular dated 26.04.2017 will continue. 3_ This circular also covers all old payments pending on engagement of the Financial Consultants for evaluation of bids of AE/IE and other consultants. 4_ This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority.
