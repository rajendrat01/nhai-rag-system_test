NHAI/13011/37-Ill/2002-PI/3) Sub:: Incorporation of agreement item in future works. Different interpretations have been made to the Technical  Specification Clause 201 with regard to the   provision of clearing and grubbing by the Contractors , Engineers, DRB and Arbitrators. As a result; there are many arbitration awards in favour of the Contractors, which are being contested by NHAI: It has now been decided with the approval of the Competent Authority that it should be clarified to all concerned that clearing and grubbing item is deemed to include backfilling upto a thickness of 150 mm. Therefore, no separate payment for earthwork to the extent of 150 mm thickness is payable. Accordingly, Technical Specification Clause 305.8 shall be amended as follows for all future contracts. Clause 305.8 Add the following at the end of the first paragraph \"The original ground level referred to above shall mean the actual levels obtained after the site is cleared and grubbed plus a thickness not exceeding 150 mm to account for the incidental item of backfilling after clearing and grubbing as per Clause 201 of the specifications to bring back the ground level to the original level which was existing before start of clearing and grubbing\" The original ground level referred above shall be same as the OGL referred in Clause 109.6.
