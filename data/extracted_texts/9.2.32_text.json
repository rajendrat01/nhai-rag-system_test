These factors lead to extension of date for completion of the Project Milestones/ Scheduled Completion Date. Timely determination and approval of extension of date for completion of the Project Milestones/ Project Completion is essential for smooth administration of the contract, besides avoiding disputes/ claims by the Contractor. 2 _ Despite the issue of comprehensive guidelines vide Policy Circular no_ 9.2.25/2019 dated 24.07.2019, the desired results, i.e:> timely determination and approval of EOTs have not been achieved. These issues of delay in approval of EOT, non-payment of Price Adjustment and imposition of penalties are time & again being raised by the Contractors at various fora. In order to expedite the determination of EOT and related issues including effective monitoring, a web based portal is heing developed by NHAI: However , till the time aforesaid portal becomes effectively operational, the following guidelines shall be followed for rescheduling of intermediate project milestones for smooth administration of the EPC contracts: (i) Rescheduling of the intermediate project milestones may be provisionally determined based on availability of unhindered land (i.e:: vacant and unencumbered work front) vis-a-vis land to be handed over as on Appointed Date, as per Contract: (ii) The provisional rescheduling of intermediate project milestones, pending determination and approval of EOTs, should be done by permitting   price adjustment & without imposition of damages for smooth administration of the contract and avoiding cashflow problem, with a clear understanding that nt M MT NHAI",
