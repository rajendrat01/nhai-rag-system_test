Accordingly, the following clarifications are provided in the matter: (i) Clause 23.4 (Payment during Construction Period): The Payments for Payment Milestones under this clause are not linked to the achievement of Project Milestones as per Schedule- G during Construction Period till the Scheduled Completion Date: The Payments during the Construction Period are based solely on the achievement of Physical Progress, and the Instalments of the BPC are adjusted for the Price Index Multiple as given in the clause. the Payment Mechanism under Clause 23.4 Operates Independent of the provisions under Clause 12.3.2. (ii) Clause 12.3.2 (Damages for Delay): If the Concessionaire fails to achieve any Project Milestone as per Schedule-G within 90 it is liable to Pay Damages as stipulated in Cl. 12.3.2. 3_ It is to be noted that Physical Progress % given in the Payment Milestones under Cl 23.4 may not match with the Project Milestones given in Schedule-G. This also supports the above Clarification. 4 This Clarification is not applicable to the Projects where Scheduled Completion is delayed: 5_ This issues with the approval of Competent Authority.
