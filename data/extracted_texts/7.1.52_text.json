In some cases, District Courts (upon approached by affected landowners under Sections 18 and 28A of the Act_ have enhanced the compensation amount payable to the erstwhile landowners, and have also directed payment of interest on the enhanced amount (under section 28 of the Act). Orders passed by the Reference Courts in such cases are invariably referred to HQ for approval, but it has been observed that the time taken for of approval by HQ has oly led to delays and the consequential increase in the interest amount payable by NHAI: 2_ In order to ensure expeditious disposal of such cases, the Competent Authority has approved to delegate full powers to Regional Officers for taking action on the orders for enhancement of compensation issued by Reference Courts under Sections 18 to 284 of the LA Act, 1894, in all cases where land was acquired under provisions of the said Act and where the RO in-charge of the State is of opinion that the orders passed & amount enhanced by the Reference Court are reasonable. In cases where the RO is of opinion that orders issued by Reference Court are not reasonable, the amount by which the Reference Court has enhanced the compensation amount shall be deposited with the Reference Court (so as to ensure that there is no increase in the interest liability to be borne by NHAI), and the orders of the Reference Court shall be challenged in the Higher Court. 3_ All pending cases covered under this category may be disposed as per aforementioned delegation of powers_ 4_ This issues with approval of the Competent Authority- (A.K.
