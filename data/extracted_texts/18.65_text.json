No.49998) Sub: Guidelines o Planning and Design of Highways passing through urban/inhabited areas-reg: National Highways (NH) and other roads connect urban areas and cities. These NH generally bypass Urban Areas but at some locations passes close to or passes through the urban areas. The traffic in urban areas is quite different from that of NH; therefore requires specific  design  considerations. In urban areas there are issues of  design speed, land availability, sight   distance availability &  large volume of pedestrians and cyclists/ 2- wheelers. 1.2 The design of NH and urban road intersections have been dealt in various IRC publications and specifications. The geometric design for urban road & streets is covered in IRC:86-2018 which provides guidelines for balanced allocation of roads space for pedestrians, cyclists & public transport users. Priority has been given to accessibility over mobility. Various typical cross sections have also been given for guidance. 2 However, the following deficiencies in integration of NH with urban Area are observed: (i) NHs are being developed independent of the urban context from which it passes. Presently, local/ urban needs are neglected, NH planned largely keeping only inter- traffic in mind (ii) The development plans for urban areas are not properly integrated with the design of highways. (iii) No provision of Non-Motorized Transportation are considered for holistic development: (iv) Lighting/ Drainage requirements are not properly transitioned from the urban areas to Sub-urban and peri-urban areas. 3. In order to integrate NH with urban roads, the following guidelines shall be adopted for design of NHs in inhabited/ urban areas: The NH must be considered as a development spine for the urban area as a part of major urban arterial road network and must ensure enhanced   connectivity to important urban destinations like airport, industrial hubs etc. (ii) All relevant information regarding the current and future development plans for the urban /semi urban areas through which the NH is passing must be collected from the Urban Local Bodies Development Authority. (iii) Assessment of traffic demand, lighting requirements, safety measures, drainage requirements etc: must be assessed in a holistic manner giving due consideration to the local requirements, resources, and planned capacities. (iv) Facilities like NMV lane, lane, service road, footpath, drains, lighting, bus shelter, bus bays etc. may be designed considering site constraint of Urban Area. Provision of safe and continuous Non-Motorized Transportation facilities (as a part of Complete Street) must be planned and designed as a part of service road depending upon  site requirements and constraints. Service Roads should be planned and integrated with local roads/ sector roads. For  safe movement of   pedestrians, footpaths of adequate width should be provided on service roads, entry/ exit lanes, I(LP 19 U U M NHAL New city cycle",
