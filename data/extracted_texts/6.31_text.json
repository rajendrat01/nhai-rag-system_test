It has been made mandatory to use Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP), e- Procurement platform developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC) for all the procurement by NHAI. The tendering cycle completes once the financial evaluation & letter of award (LoA) are uploaded on the CPPP. Instances have come to notice where NHAI officials did not upload the finance evaluation & LoA in the e-Tendering Portal and thereby not completed the tendering: 2 This has been viewed seriously and it has been decided that henceforth it may be ensured that prior to issue of LoA, financial evaluation & LoA are uploaded o the portal. It may also be ensured that the UPC Code and Tender ID are indicated on the LoA. Failure will attract, action against the concerned officials. 3 _ help desk has been established with following email id, phone number for assistance: Tele: 25074100/4200 Extn. 1332 E-Mail ID: etenderhelpdesk@nhai org This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority.
