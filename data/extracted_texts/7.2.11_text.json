NHAI/Utility Shifting/2021 Comp. No.54751) Sub: Revision of Delegation of Power to sanction the estimates of utility shifting and detailed instructions/guidelines for processing utility shifting estimates in view of serious findings of Vigilance. It has been observed that the estimates approved in principle' by the utility owning agencies are being forwarded by most   of the PDs to ROs without  proper site verification, scrutiny/ due diligence and compliance of checklist / guidelines issued earlier vide Circular dated 07.11.2017 and dated 02.05.2019 (copies enclosed)  The checks/ due diligence at the level of ROs before sanctioning of such estimates is found to be inadequate in most of the cases, as observed during scrutiny by Vigilance (Ref. enclosed Circular dt. 22.09.2020 of CVO): In some cases, the total amount of sanctioned estimates of utility shifting has been found to exceed the corresponding provision in the sanctioned project cost approved by the Competent Authority and the revised project sanction has not been taken. In some vigilance cases, the estimates have been found to be inflated and the payments have been allowed based o the estimates, without any site verification of the executed works. 1.2 In many cases, checking by Headquarter led to reduction of the estimate to 20% and the works were successfully executed within this reduced cost (eg , Rs. 10 Cr. in place of earlier estimate of Rs. 58 This has led to vigilance proceedings against many NHAI Officers: 1.3 All the above instances show wastage of public/ tax payers' money. It has also brought bad name to NHAI. 2 The above position warrants review of the Delegation of Power (DoP) given to ROs and issue of detailed guidelines. Accordingly, EC in 452nd meeting revised the DoP as under for approval of Utility Shifting estimates in partial modification of DoP issued vide Policy Guidelines No 18.24/2017 dated 21.08.2017 . Revised DoP Subject To whom Revised DoP for each concerned delegated division of utility owning agency Approval of  Utility   shifting RO Rs. 5 Crore estimates, public utilities Member Concerned More than Rs.5.0 Crore. to Rs. 10.0 only (electrical, water and Crore other public utilities) Executive Full Powers Committee 3_ It was also decided that RO will upload sanction letter and copy of all the estimates approved by them earlier under DoP vide Policy Guidelines No. 18.24/2017 dated 21.08.2017 on Data Lake for detailed audit: This should be followed for future estimates as well, sanctioned by ROs, under the revised DoP as above.
