NHALF&A/Policy Matters/2003/210) Sub: Recording in Measurement Books It has come to the notice that in one case though the material advance was to the contractor; it was not adjusted out of the monthly Interim Payment Certificates (IPCs) and even got omitted to be recovered from the final bill. Upon examination of the issue, it came to light that the material advance to the contractor was not recorded properly in the Measurement Book resulting in such omission of adjustment of advance out of the future IPCs including the final bill. 2_ All concerned are advised t0 be careful in future and ensure that all the payments made to the contractors (including material advance etc ) are properly recorded in the Measurement Books so that adjustment of such payments, if any; could be made out of the future IPCslfinal bill, This issues with the approval of the Chairman. 0 _ Scamailav [S.
