No. 49912) Sub.: Riding Quality at approaches/ Expansion Joints of Structures. Expansion Joints are vital for life of a bridge and must be correctly installed and maintained in order to function properly. The two major causes of joint failures are improper installation and insufficient maintenance of the joint resulting in cracking or distortion/   crushing of the joint material, compromising the entire bridge's structural integrity and riding quality. It has been observed that in most places the approaches/ expansion joints of structures like major bridges/ viaducts/ elevated roads are not smooth and cause discomfort to the road users due to jerks. This concern was expressed by NHAI in the past as well, as may be seen from the enclosed Policy Circular Tech-48/2005 dated 17.02.2005, but the situation has not   improved. The jerks/  bumps on the completed structures reflect poor quality of work and it has brought a bad name to NHAI. 2 Therefore, in completed/ ongoing projects, PD shall ask AE/IE/SC to immediately inspect the deviations at the  joints in transverse direction & vertical   alignment in longitudinal direction at all the completed structures using NSV / Laser Profilometer and instruct the Concessionaire/ Contractor to rectify the approaches/ expansion joints on structures immediately at their cost in case the deviation is beyond the permissible limits as given in IRC SP:69-2011 (Smm in transverse direction & 3% in longitudinal direction) , which causes jerks/ bumps. After rectification, AE/IE/SC shall re-inspect the locations using NSV / Laser Profilometer again and confirm that the approaches/ expansion joints have been rectified and the riding surface on the structures is smooth, otherwise shall again do the rectification till it is perfectly rectified as confirmed by NSV / Laser Profilometer. The penalty as prescribed in the agreements shall also be levied for poor riding quality on the Contractor/ Concessionaire. After the reports of AE/IE/SC, PDs shall personally inspect and confirm that there are no jerks/ bumps and the quality is smooth: The Quality Teams from HQ will also check the riding surface and rectification done during their inspections. 3 PD and AE/IE/SC shall load on Data Lake the timelines for inspection, rectification, reinspection and confirmation reports on smooth riding surface, project-wise, alongwith the readings of NSV / Laser Profilometer taken during the inspections. However , the rectification on all expansion joints shall be completed within 60 of the circular. The above procedure shall be followed in future scrupulously before accepting the completed structures: 5. Structures shall have minimum number of Expansion Joints, which may be ensured while finalising DPR / defining scope of work. This may be achieved by adopting longer spans, making the superstructure continuous or by adopting integrated structures. Contd to Pg-2 'HT { U MI NHAL riding days Iilo",
