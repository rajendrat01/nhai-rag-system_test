No.230259)} Sub: Procedure for Handover Takeover of E-Office Files & User credentials of Various Portals at the time of transfer during Repatriation Transfer/ Posting/ Superannuation or Assignment of additional charge It has been observed that a significant number of cases on e-files remain unprocessed because of  inadequate handover  takeover after Repatriation Transfer Posting or Superannuation. This results in pendency of e-Files in the accounts of inactive users: The core issue lies in the lack of a structured process for   transferring e-Files during handover /takeover. As a result, various e-files remain unattended in inactive accounts, causing delays in decisions as no one assumes responsibility for these pending e-Files: 2 This situation is further complicated when Officers Leave the Organization, often without prior notice after securing a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from various divisions. However , this clearance is often obtained without disposing of or properly transferring e-Office Files. Since NOC is issued without verifying the status of pending e- Files, it leads to significant challenges for both the concerned divisions as well as the Officers who are subsequently tasked with managing these unresolved files. 3 To overcome this issue and ensure smooth operational continuity, the following measures will be enforced: Mandatory Handover_of_e-Files and e-Receipts: When an Officer is Repatriated/ Transferred/ Posted or Superannuated they must properly hand over all e-Files and e-Receipts to the newly appointed Officer. This handover is essential to ensure no pending files remain unresolved_ The list of files should be generated directly from the e-office system rather than being typed manually to avoid subjectivity. Handling Files in the absence of_an Incumbent: When no Incumbent Officer has been appointed or has to assume the position, the Officer's pending files must be transferred to their immediate Superior or Subordinate: The controlling Officer shall decide to whom the charge should be handed over. NOC to be linked to e-Office clearance: The IT division is to issue an NOC only after the Officer ensures there are no pending files in their e-office account. The final NOC would be withheld until all e-Files and e-Receipts are either disposed of or transferred to the appropriate Officer and confirmation of this is obtained from the IT division. Non-issuance of_Last Pay Certificate _(LPC)in absence of_proper_NDIOC: The Finance Division shall issue LPC to the outgoing officer only after the ND/OC is obtained from the following Divisions at HQ: Contd_2I- 'M 7 U 9 NHAL reg: yet",
