To this end, the erstwhile Ministry of Surface \nTransport (MoST ) has constituted a permanent Automotive Industry Standards \nCommittee (AISC) vide order No. RT -11028/11/97 -MVL dated September 15, 1997. \nThe standards prepared by AISC will be approved by the permanent CMVR \nTechnical Standing Committee (CTSC). After approv al, the Automotiv e Research \nAssociation of India  (ARAI), Pune, being the secretariat of the AIS Committee, will \npublish this standard.  \nIntelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are globally proven  systems  to optimize the \nutilization of existing transport infrastructure and improve transportation systems in \nterms of efficiency, quality, comfort and safety. Having realized  the potential of ITS, \nGovernment bodies and other organizations in India are presently  working towards \nimplementing various  components of  ITS across the country.  \nThe first step taken for creation and implementation of ITS was  holding  a National \nWorkshop titled “User Requirements for Interactive ITS Architecture”, which was \nconducted as a co llaboration between SIAM and ASRTU on 26th & 27th February \n2015. This was primarily focused on ITS in Public Bus Transportation. Nonetheless, \nthe workshop helped to create the outline for “National Intelligent Transport System \nArchitecture and Policy for P ublic Transport (Bus)”, which was submitted by ASRTU \nand SIAM to the government   \nIn the 44th & 45th CMVR -TSC, Chairman had directed - standardization activities to \nbe initiated on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) - Vehicle Location Tracking, \nCamera Surveillance System and Emergency Request Button . The committee \nintended to extend  the above user requirements to all public transportation namely – \nbuses,  taxis , etc. The current document covers the requirements for Vehicle Location \nTrack ing and Emergency Button . The other ITS components like PIS, CCTV system, \nFare collection etc. are deliberated and would be addressed in later phase and could \nbe  added as separate parts to the current document. .  \nBased on these directions, the AISC Pan el on ITS has prepared this AIS -140 titled, \n“Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) - Requirements for Public T ransport \nVehicle Operation”  \nThe panel has also deliberated and identified the necessary elements for an effective \nimplementation of vehicle level ITS system.   \n \n 94457/2020/DGM (HOU)218AIS-140  \n \nIV \n This standard  has been prepared by considering inputs received from all stake holders \non ITS, mainly - \na. Direction s of CMVR -TSC \nb. Detailed S pecification  Document on Vehicle Tracking Devices (dated 4th March \n2015 , published by MoRTH )  \nc. Report of Department of Telecom (Telecom Engineering Centre) Automotive \nWorking Group on M2M enablement in Intelligent Transport System (ITS)   \nThis AIS on ITS, has been provisioned for device level approval ; including \nconstruction and target vehicle level  approval. Device  level approval is needed to \nenable retro -fitment of ITS systems on in -use vehicles. This will ensure ITS Backend \nControl Centre  infrastructure already presents  with the STUs can be more fully \nutilized and make the investment in the Backen d Control Centre  infrastructure more \nviable.  \nAs per the  direction of CMVR -TSC which needed the C ommunication Protocol and \nBackend Control Centre requirement for tracking and handling the alerts to be \ndetailed, the same has been addressed in Section 6 & 7, as detailed below.  \n \n The devices would transmit data to the Backend Control Centre using 2G/3G/4G \nwireless connectivity (with SMS fall back) as per the protocol provided in \nrespective sections (Section 6).  \n \n The data from the devices would travel over the wireless telecom service provider \nnetwork and finally get delivered at the Backend Control Centre . The detail about \nDevice to Backend Communication Mechanism is mentioned in Section 7.  \nBIS and AIS both have panels which are formulating standards on ITS. It is our belief \nthat taking the AIS route for the 1st implementation would give the faster  time for \nadoption. Experts in the BIS panel and in DIMTS who are working on these subjects \nhave been  co-opted and inv ited to work in the AIS panel to make the AIS as robust as \npossible. Once implemented and all implementation problems in this emerging \ntechnology have been eliminated , BIS standard can be made with further inclusions if \nany resulting from consultations wit h the wider stakeholder community. Because of \nthese reasons, we recommend the AIS route for regulation creation and first \nimplementation.  \nOne of the major concerns  which has been raised during the panel meetings is on the \nissue of privacy encroachments by ITS systems. Some overseas member countries of \nthe 1958 agreement have been continuously emphasizing in WP29 forums that the \nregulated ITS system must not encroach on privac y. Towards this, the panel has \nsubmitted a document titled ‘ Data Privacy in Transportation ITS ’ To help the system \ndevelopers deal with these issues. Further,  system developer can also take guidance \nfrom ‘IS/ISO/TR 12859:  2009 - Intelligent Transport Syste ms — System Architecture \n— Privacy Aspects in ITS Standards and Systems’  while developing their systems to \nmeet the requirements of this standard.  The Panel and the Automotive Industry \nStandards Committee (AISC) responsible for preparation of this standard  are given in \nAnnexure -D and Annexure -E respectively.  \n \n 94457/2020/DGM (HOU)219AIS-140  \n \nV \n  \n \nCONTENTS  \nClause No.  Details  Page No.  \n1.0 Scope  1/40 \n2.0 Application For CMVR Type Approval  3/40 \n3.0 ITS Functions and Requirements  4/40 \n4.0 Communication Protocol  10/40  \n5.0 Construction and Installation  16/40  \n6.0 Functional, Performance, Durability, Environmental and \nProtocol Tests  17/40  \n7.0 Device to Backend Communication Mechanism  31/40  \nList of Annexures  \nANNEXURE -A Information to be Submitted for Type Approval  34/40  \nANNEXURE -B Criteria for Extension of Type Approval  35/40  \nANNEXURE -C Physical Interfaces (Connectors) for Power and I/Os  36/40  \nANNEXURE -D Composition of Panel  38/40  \nANNEXURE -E Committee  Composition  40/40  \n 94457/2020/DGM (HOU)220AIS-140  \n \n1/40 \n  \nIntelligent Transportation Systems ( ITS) - Requirements for  \nPublic Transport Vehicle Operation  \n1.0 SCOPE  \n1.A.0 This standard applies to both individual components as well as system \nenvironment  intended to be used in Public transport vehicles . \n1.A.1  INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS -VLT WITH AN \nEMERGENCY SYSTEM  \nRequirements on ITS devices and functions - Vehicle Location Tracking \nand Emergency Button .  \n1.B.0 DEFINITIONS :  \nFor the purpose of this standard, definitions are given below:  \n1.B.1 “Acquisition sensitivity”  refers to the minimum signal level at which the \ndevice is able to successfully perform a cold start TTFF. The acquisition \nsensitivity test is a simulated signal test.  \n1.B.2 “Assisted GPS (A -GPS)”  is a system allowing satellite receivers to obtain \ninformation from communication network resources to assist in acquiring \nsatellite location. A -GPS system is especially useful when the receiver is in \na location where it is difficult for the satellite sig nals to penetrate. In \naddition to providing better coverage, A -GPS also improves the start -up \ntime, which is the time required by the satellites and the receivers to \nestablish a reliable connection.  \n1.B.3 “Circular Error Probability (CEP)”  is defined as t he radius of a circle \ncentered on the true value that contains 50% of the actual GPS \nmeasurements. So a receiver with 5 meter CEP accuracy will be within 5 \nmeter of the true measurement 50% of the time. The other 50% of the time \nthe measurement will be in error by more than one meter.  \n1.B.4 “Dilution of Precision (DOP)”  is the degree of proximity of the location \ndata to their mean value. The relative position of satellites affects the \naccuracy of location calculation by the locating module. Location \ncoordinates computed when the satellites are clustered together suffer f rom \ndilution of precision (DOP), a factor that multiplies the associated errors. \nThe DOP for an ideal satellites constellation arrangement equals close to 1, \nwhich does not magnify the underlying errors.  \n1.B.5 “Distance Root Mean Square (DRMS also called RMS, 1Sigma)”  \nThis is computed as square root of the average of the squared horizontal \nposition errors with 65% probability. The position expressed has the \nprobability of being within a circle with radius with 65% probability. A \nlocating module with 6 metr e DRMS accuracy would be within 6 meters of \nits actual position 65% of the time.  \n 94457/2020/DGM (HOU)221AIS-140  \n \n2/40 \n 1.B.6 “Emergency Button”  A button provided in vehicle for passengers or crew \nmembers to send specialized data packet /SMS to Centralized regulatory \nserver to indicate safety/panic situation caused by human or natural \ndisaster or vehicle accident etc.  \n1.B.7 “Global Positioning System  (GPS) ” is a space -based radio navigation \nsystem. It provides positioning, navigation, and timing services to military \nand civilian users o n a continuous basis.  \n1.B.8 “Sensitivity ” refers to the minimum signal strength level at which locating \nmodule can successfully perform a location fix. A GNSS locating module \nhas two different sensitivity levels – acquisition sensitivity and tracking \nsensitivity.  \n1.B.9 “Time to First Fix (TTFF)” describes the time required for a tracking \ndevice to acquire adequate satellite signals and related data (almanac and \nephemeris data) to compute location.  \n1.B.10 “Tracking Sensitivity”  refers to the minimum signal level at which the \ndevice is able to successfully maintain the location fix. The acquisition \nsensitivity test is a simulated signal test.  \n1.B.11 “Vehicle Location Tracking (VLT)”  device uses satellite based location \ntechnology to determine and record the precise location of a vehicle at \nregular intervals. The location data so determined can be stored within the \ndevice, and/or can be transmitted to the Backend Control Centre using a  \nwireless communication modem built in the device.  \n1.C          REFERENCES :  \nThe References are listed below . \n1.C.1 National Level Vehicle Security and Tracking System – Detailed \nSpecification Document on Vehicle Tracking Devices (GPS) (Published by \nMoRTH MoRTH).  \n1.C.2 APTA TCIP - American Public Transportation Association (APTA) \nStandard for Transit Communications Interface Profiles (TCIP)  \n1.C.3 EBSF - European Bus System of the Future  \n1.C.4 ISO 11898 -1:2003 Road vehicles — Controller area network  (CAN)  \n1.C.5 SAE J 1939 Recommended Practice for a Serial Control and \nCommunications Vehicle Network.   \n1.C.6 Bus-FMS -Standard  \n1.C.7 SAE USCAR 18 / USCAR18 -3 - FAKRA SMB RF CONNECTOR \nSUPPLEMENT  \n1.C.8 National ITS Architecture - U.S. Department of Transportation  \n1.C.9 ISO 17185 -1:2014 - Intelligent transport systems — Public transport user \ninformation — Part 1: Standards framework for public information \nsystems  \n 94457/2020/DGM (HOU)222AIS-140  \n \n3/40 \n 1.C.10 Trans model  Standard (CEN/TC 278 WG3/SG4, Reference Entity -\nRelationship Data Model for Public Transport) - European reference data \nmodel for Public Transport operations developed within several European \nProjects - EN 12896:2006  \n1.C.11 Specification for Entity -Relati onship for describing the main fixed objects \nin Public transport CEN/TC 278, 2008 - EN 28701:2012  \n1.C.12 RTIG (Real Time Information Group Ltd) - Digital Air Interface Protocol  \n1.C.13 SIRI (Service Interface for Real Time Information) European Technical \nSpecification (TS) - CEN/TS 15531  \n1.C.14 NeTEx -Network Exchange European Technical Specification (TS) \nCEN/TS 16614  \n1.C.15 NaPTAN (National Public Transport Access Node)  \n1.C.16 ISO 15638 -15:2014 Intelligent transport systems – Framework for \ncooperative t elematics applications for regulated vehicles (TARV) – Part \n15: Vehicle location monitoring  \n1.C.17 ISO 15638 -5:2013 Intelligent transport systems – Framework for \ncollaborative Telematics Applications for Regulated commercial freight \nVehicles (TARV) – Part 5: Generic vehicle information  \n1.C.18 NMEA -0183: The NMEA 0183 standard defines an electrical interface and \ndata protocol for communications between marine instrumentation.  \n1.C.19 IS/ISO/TR 12859:2009 – Intelligent Transport System -System \nArchitecture -Privacy Aspects in ITS standards and systems  \n1.C.20 Report of Department of Telecom (Telecom Engineering Centre) \nAutomotive Working Group on M2M enablement in Intelligent Transport \nSystem (ITS)   \n1.C.21 URL: http://tec.gov.in/pdf/M2M/M2M%20E nablement%20in%20ITS.pdf  \n2.0 APPLICATION FOR CMVR TYPE APPROVAL  \n2.1 The application for CMVR device level approval shall be accompanied by \ninformation on the system specification as mentioned in Annexure A.  \n2.2 Type approval shall involve following steps:  \n2.2.1  Device Approval : Approval provided at Device level for compliance to \nthis standard.  \nThese approved devices can be fitted / retro -fitted by manufacturer/ dealer/ \npermit holder/system integrator  in any vehicle model provided it shall meet \ninstallation requirements as mentioned in Clause No. 5 of this standard. \nFor manufacturers seeking vehicle level approval with approved VLT with \nEmergency Buttons fitted shall only require installation approval as per the \nprovisions of Clause 5 and Sub -Clause 6.1 of Clause 6.  \n 94457/2020/DGM (HOU)223AIS-140  \n \n4/40 \n 2.3 Modifications and Extension of Approval  \n2.3.1 Every modification pertaining to the information, even if the changes \nare not technical in nature declared in accordance with clause 2.1, shall \nbe intimated by the VLT with Emergency Button Manufacturer to the  \ntest agency.  \n2.3.1 .1 If the changes are in parameters not related to the provisions, no further \naction need be taken.  \n2.3.1.2  If the changes are in parameters related to the provisions, the test agency, \nwhich has issued the certificate of compliance, may then consider, based \non the justification p rovided by the VLT with Emergency Button \nManufacturer and reviewed by the test agency, whether,  \nThe model with the changed specifications still complies with provisions;
