The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways vide letter No. RWINH/34061/3/2004-S&R(B) dated 23rd January, 2012 has conveyed that there are large number of bridges involving Reinforced Concrete Components in marine environment on National Highways running parallel and near to seashore in the country. Keeping in view the large investment requirement for constructing these bridges aS well aS high cost involved in its maintenance subsequent to corrosion related distress, it is advisable that the possibility of corrosion may be reduced, therefore , the implementing agencies shall adopt IRC-SP-80-2008 and subsequent revisions on guidelines for corrosion prevention, monitoring and remedial measures for concrete bridge structures for bridges located in environment susceptible to severe corrosion at design, construction and maintenance stages. 2 This is in supersession of 'Ministry'$ Circular No. RWINH/34041/44/91-S&R dated 14th March 2000 regarding use of Fusion Bonded Epoxy Coated (FBEC) reinforcement in bridges on National Highways and other Centrally Sponsored Projects. 3 This issues with the approval of Chairman: 09 (V.K.Sharma) Chief General Manager (Coord./LA) To, Allofficers and_employees ot HQ/ZOMROs[PIUs[CMUslSite Qffices T T NHAL",
