Further, this   practice has been resulting in delays in processing of the proposals, without much value addition; Hence; it has been decided now to dispense with this practice forthwith. the Technical Divisions should submit the proposals directly to the EC through their respective members and they would be solely responsible for the detailed examination of the case. (iii) Agenda Item should be very brief (maximum to 2 pages only) and in the format enclosed: The text should be in ARIAL with a font size Of 11 with 1.5 spacing: The content of the Agenda Item as well as the decisions sought should be clear and unambiguous.
