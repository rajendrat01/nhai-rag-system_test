This is not linked with clause 6.3(b)(f)_ 3_ The requirement of signing of Concession agreement envisaged under clause 6.3(b)(f) is required to be fulfilled for making the DPR consultant eligible for final payment: This does not seem to be feasible, as on the basis of DPR, the approval is obtained from Competent Authority and thereafter bid invitation/submission/evaluation takes considerable time which is beyond the control of DPR consultant. If these activities are delayed beyond the prescribed period under clause 6.3 (6)(f), the consultant will loose its 6th stage (final) payment due for completion of DPR work 4_ In view of above, provision under clause 6.3(b)(f) is not in true of the contract. The said clause be deleted from all such contracts SO that the DPR consultants may not be deprived of their 6th stage (final) payment after completion of DPR work: M 2s/-7 (V.K.
