In  addition, there are issues of incorrect provisioning of quantum and rates of items taken in the estimates by the utility owning agencies and upgradation of facilities which further compound the problem affecting expedient approval and consequent execution. 3. In order to tide over the above deficiencies, it has been decided to include the items of utility shifting in the scope of work while inviting bids: This should serve the twin objective of market/ competitive   discovery of rates of utility shifting works and reduce delays in the execution of such utility shifting: 4 Following guidelines are issued in this regard:  4.1 The scope of work and estimated cost of   shifting of utilities (excluding the supervision charges which and without credit of dismantled Iscrap material) shall be included in the bids under civil construction cost as per the detailed estimates in compliance with check list issue vide NHAI HQ letter dated NHAI/11012/Gen /Utility/ 2017/108225 dated 07.11.2017 duly reviewed /verified by the DPR consultant and sanctioned by the utility agencies at the appropriate level.
