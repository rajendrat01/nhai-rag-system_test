No. 213951)} Sub: Clarification on calculation of Base Date ~reg: The Standard EPC Agreement states that \"Base Date\" means the last date of the calendar month, which precedes the Bid Due Date by at least 28 (twenty eight) days. However, in order to ensure uniformity in all projects and bring more clarity to field units, it has been decided that the logical consideration in the matter is that the Base date shall be last date of Calendar month, but it shall also precede the bid due date by 28 days. The following examples may be referred for avoidance of doubt: Example 1: If the bid is received on 28th to 31st of January, then the date 28 to bid due date lies 1st to 4th of January. The base date will be 31st December . Example 2: If the bid is received on 1st to 27th of January, then the date 28 to bid due date lies between 5th to 30th December . The base date will be 30th November . 2_ The calculation of the Base Date shall be done according to the rationale explained in this policy circular. 3_ This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. 16 lul2?
