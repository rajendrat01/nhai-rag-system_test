NHAIIFGA/CGAG/2O17-18/SKS) Sub-Guidelines for Physical Verification of Assets Periodic   Physical verification of assets is an integral part of accounting system: This ensures assets purchased by an organization are physically available and are being to use for the purpose it was procured. It also helps decision making in respect of repair, renewal, replacement / purchase of new assets. It has been observed that despite clear instruction by_NHAL_HQ_and several audit_observations_ the system of annual physical verification of assets is not being practiced uniformly across all the units of NHAI including NHAI, HQ where the number of assets under Furniture Fixtures, Office Equipment, Computer EDP and Electrical Installation categories are predominantly high. This is reflected through various audit observations by CGAG and also creates   uncertainty about the availability and physical condition of assets. 2 It has been  decided that in respect of all the assets of NHAI, Physical verification is to be carried out annually and verification report in the prescribed format (Annexure-A) is to be submitted to accounts division so that the same may be produced before audit: This includes Assets of all categories held by NHAI a) purchased out of own fund, b) Purchased for toll plazas, c) Purchased out of grant, d) Received under EPC contract/ Concession agreement: 3 The verification work is to be performed at the end of the every financial year between 1st to April by a three member committee as given below Location HQ RO PIU Crucial date Appointing CGM (T) of Regional Officer Project Director Committee to be Authority concerned division concerned concerned appointed by 15th at HO Feb:_every Committee Concerned GM (T), GM (T), DGM Project Director, Verification report Members DGM (T)/ Manager (T)/ Manager (T) DGM (T)/ Manager to be submitted by (T) of the_division, of the RO, Senior (T) Senior most the committee by TI M R WT NHAI put 15th year",
