NO_ RW./6-23012/01/2019-WGA (Pt.III) dated 06/07/2023 and the same was circulated vide NHAI Policy Circular no. 9.4.25/2023 dated 07.08.2023 2_ In this context, in order to take a decision on implementation of a stretch on PBMC mode or through strengthening/ improvement work contract, the following procedure shall be followed: (i) Residual Life of the existing Pavement shall be evaluated by using FWD for deciding the strengthening/ overlay requirement. For this purpose, the following criteria is to be considered: (a) In case the Residual Life of more than 80% length of the section can be increased to at least 7 years after proposed overlay with BC as part of Periodic Maintenance, then such cases may be considered for PBMC works. (b) In case, it is not possible to fulfil criteria given in (a) above, then the project may be taken up for strengthening/ improvement on item rate (single %) tender instead of PBMC. (ii) Design of the part of the section proposed for structural improvement/ strengthening in the Initial Rectification Phase [as per case (i) (a) above] should be such that it should more or less match with the residual life of the remaining section, as envisioned, after considering overlay as part of Periodic Maintenance. However , in exceptional circumstances when substantial part of Granular layers [i.e. more than 10% of project length] are to be replaced, then such layers shall be designed for full design life as prescribed in IRC-37.
