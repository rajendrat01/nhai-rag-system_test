No.43413} Sub: Regarding replies being givenby Technical Divisions as Asper RFP' in response to the pre-bid queries in various contracts (BOT/HAMEPCITOT, etc.). It has been observed that while giving the replies to the pre-bid queries most of the times the replies are given by Technical Divisions as As per RFP' which does not convey clear view of the Authority to the Bidders. 2 Henceforth, while giving the replies to the pre-bid queries, answers should not be given as As per RFP' at all. Instead, the provisions of the clauses in the bid documents should be clearly explained in the reply in order to avoid any ambiguity leading to litigation at a later date 3.
