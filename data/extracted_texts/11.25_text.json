For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that tests pursuant to \nthis Clause 13.3 shall be undertaken in addition to and independent of the tests \nthat shall be carried out by the Concessionaire for its own quality assurance in \naccordance wi th Good Industry Practice. It is also agreed that a copy of the \nresults of such tests shall be sent by the Concessionaire to the Independent \nEngineer forthwith.  \n \n13.4 Delays during construction  \n \nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Clause 12.4.2, if  the Concessionaire \ndoes not achieve any of the Project Milestones or the Independent Engineer \nshall have reasonably determined that the rate of progress of Construction \nWorks is such that  [Six-Laning]  is not likely to be achieved by the Scheduled \n[Six-Laning]  Date, it shall notify the Concessionaire to this effect, and the \nConcessionaire shall, within 15 (fifteen) days of such notice, by a \ncommunication inform the Independent Engineer in reasonable detail about the \nsteps it proposes to take to expedite progress  and the period within which it \nshall achieve the Project Completion Date.  \n \n13.5 Suspension of unsafe Construction Works  \n \n13.5.1  Upon recommendation of the Independent Engineer to this effect, the \nAuthority may by notice require the Concessionaire to suspe nd forthwith the \nwhole or any part of the Construction Works if, in the reasonable opinion of \nthe Authority, such work threatens the safety of the Users and pedestrians.  \n \n13.5.2  The Concessionaire shall, pursuant to the notice under Clause 13.5.1, suspend \nthe Construction Works or any part thereof for such time and in such manner \nas may be  specified by the Authority and thereupon carry out remedial \nmeasures to secure the safety of suspended works and the Users. The \nConcessionaire may by notice require the I ndependent Engineer to inspect \nsuch remedial measures forthwith and make a report to the Authority \nrecommending whether or not the suspension hereunder may be revoked. \nUpon receiving the recommendations of the Independent Engineer, the \nAuthority shall eith er revoke such suspension or instruct the Concessionaire to \ncarry out such other and further remedial measures as may be necessary in the  \n58 \n reasonable opinion of the Authority, and the procedure set forth in this Clause \n13.5 shall be repeated until the suspe nsion hereunder is revoked.  \n \n13.5.3  Subject to the provisions of Clause 34.7, all reasonable costs incurred for \nmaintaining and protecting the Construction Works or part thereof during the \nperiod of suspension (the “ Preservation Costs ”), shall be borne by the \nConcessionaire; provided that if the suspension has occurred as a result of any \nbreach of this Agreement by the Authority, the Preservation Costs shall be \nborne by the Authority.  \n \n13.5.4  If suspension of Construction Works is for reasons not attributab le to the \nConcessionaire, the Independent Engineer shall determine any extension of the \ndates set forth in the Project Completion Schedule to which the Concessionaire \nis reasonably entitled, and shall notify the Authority accordingly whereupon \nthe Authorit y shall extend such Project Completion Schedule dates in \naccordance with the recommendations of the Independent Engineer. In the \nevent that the Scheduled [Six-Laning]  Date is extended pursuant hereto, the \nConcession Period shall be deemed to be extended by  a period equal in length \nto the period of extension of the Scheduled [Six-Laning]  Date.  \n \n13.6    Video recording  \n \nDuring the Construction Period, the Concessionaire shall provide to the \nAuthority for every calendar quarter, a video recording, which will b e \ncompiled into a 3 (three) -hour compact disc or digital video disc, as the case \nmay be, covering the status and progress of Construction Works in that quarter. \nThe first such video recording shall be provided to the Authority within 7 \n(seven) days of the Appointed Date and thereafter, no later than 15 (fifteen) \ndays after the close of each quarter.   \n59 \n ARTICLE 14  \nCOMPLETION CERTIFICATE  \n14.1 Tests  \n14.1.1  At least 30 (thirty) days prior to the likely completion of the Project Highway, \nthe Concessionaire shall n otify the Independent Engineer of its intent to subject \nthe Project Highway to Tests. The date and time of each of the Tests shall be \ndetermined by the Independent Engineer in consultation with the \nConcessionaire, and notified to the Authority who may desi gnate its \nrepresentative to witness the Tests. The Concessionaire shall provide such \nassistance as the Independent Engineer may reasonably require for conducting \nthe Tests. In the event of the Concessionaire and the Independent Engineer \nfailing to mutually  agree on the dates for conducting the Tests, the \nConcessionaire shall fix the dates by not less than 10 (ten) days’ notice  to the \nIndependent Engineer.  \n \n14.1.2  All Tests shall be conducted in accordance with Schedule -I. The Independent \nEngineer shall obse rve, monitor and review the results of the Tests to \ndetermine compliance of the Project Highway with Specifications and \nStandards and if it is reasonably anticipated or determined by the Independent \nEngineer during the course of any Test that the performan ce of the Project \nHighway or any part thereof does not meet the Specifications and Standards, \nit shall have the right to suspend or delay such Test and require the \nConcessionaire to remedy and rectify the defects or deficiencies. Upon \ncompletion of each Te st, the Independent Engineer shall provide to the \nConcessionaire and the Authority copies of all Test data including detailed \nTest results. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly agreed that the \nIndependent Engineer may require the Concessionaire to c arry out or cause to \nbe carried out additional Tests, in accordance with Good Industry Practice, for \ndetermining the compliance of the Project Highway with Specifications and \nStandards.  \n \n14.2 Completion Certificate  \nUpon completion of Construction Works and  the Independent Engineer \ndetermining the Tests to be successful, it shall forthwith issue to the \nConcessionaire and the Authority a certificate substantially in the form set \nforth in Schedule -J (the “ Completion Certificate ”). \n \n 14.3 Provisional Certificat e \n14.3.1  Subject to the provisions of Clause 14.3.2, the Independent Engineer may, at \nthe request of the Concessionaire, issue a provisional certificate of completion \nsubstantially in the form set forth in Schedule -J (the “ Provisional \nCertificate ”) if the Tests are successful and the Project Highway can be safely \nand reliably placed in commercial operation though certain works or things \nforming part thereof are outstanding and not yet complete. In such an event,  \n60 \n the Provisional Certificate shall have append ed thereto a list of outstanding \nitems signed jointly by the Independent Engineer and the Concessionaire (the \n“Punch List ”); provided that the Independent Engineer shall not withhold the \nProvisional Certificate for reason of any work remaining incomplete i f the \ndelay in completion thereof is due to is attributable to the Authority; provided \nfurther that the Punch List shall also include the cost of completion for each of \nthe outstanding items.  \n \n14.3.2  The Parties hereto expressly agree that a Provisional Ce rtificate under this \nClause 14.3 may, upon request of the Concessionaire to this effect, be issued \nfor operating part of the Project Highway, if the Concessionaire has completed \nconstruction of 90% (Ninety per cent) of the Site made available to it up to 1 80 \ndays from the Appointed Date. Upon issue of such Provisional Certificate, the \nprovisions of Article 15 shall apply to such completed part, and the rights and \nobligations of the Concessionaire for and in respect of such completed part of \nthe Project shal l be construed accordingly.   \n \n14.4 Completion of Punch List items  \n14.4.1  All items in the Punch List shall be completed by the Concessionaire within \n90 (ninety) days of the date of issue of the Provisional Certificate and for any \ndelay thereafter, other th an for reasons solely attributable to the Authority or \ndue to Force Majeure, the Authority shall be entitled to recover Damages from \nthe Concessionaire to be calculated and paid for each day of delay until all \nitems are completed, at the lower of (a) 0.1% (zero point one per cent) of the \nPerformance Security, and (b) 0.2% (zero point two per cent) of the cost of \ncompleting such items as estimated by the Independent Engineer. Subject to \npayment of such Damages, the Concessionaire shall be entitled to a furth er \nperiod not exceeding 120 (one hundred and twenty) days for completion of the \nPunch List items. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that if completion of \nany item is delayed for reasons solely attributable to the Authority or due to \nForce Majeure, t he completion date thereof shall be determined by the \nIndependent Engineer in accordance with Good Industry Practice, and such \ncompletion date shall be deemed to be the date of issue of the Provisional \nCertificate for the purposes of Damages, if any, payab le for such item under \nthis Clause 14.4.1.   \n \n14.4.2  Upon completion of all Punch List items, the Independent Engineer shall issue \nthe Completion Certificate. Failure of the Concessionaire to complete all the \nPunch List items within the time set forth in Cl ause 14.4.1 for any reason, other \nthan conditions constituting Force Majeure or for reasons solely attributable to \nthe Authority, shall entitle the Authority at its discretion to get the Punch List \nitems completed at the risk and cost of the Concessionaire  or to terminate this \nAgreement.   \n  \n61 \n 14.5 Withholding of Provisional or Completion Certificate  \n14.5.1   If the Independent Engineer determines that the Project Highway or any part \nthereof does not conform to the provisions of this Agreement and cannot be \nsafely and reliably placed in commercial operation, it shall forthwith make a \nreport in this behalf and send copies thereof to the Authority and the \nConcessionaire within 15 (fifteen) days of conducting such tests. Upon receipt \nof such a report from the Indepe ndent Engineer and after conducting its own \ninspection, if the Authority is of the opinion that the Project Highway is not fit \nand safe for commercial service, it shall, within 30 (thirty) days of receiving \nthe aforesaid report, notify the Concessionaire o f the defects and deficiencies \nin the Project Highway and direct the Independent Engineer to withhold \nissuance of the Provisional Certificate or Completion Certificate, as the case \nmay be. Upon receipt of such notice, the Concessionaire shall remedy and \nrectify such defects or deficiencies and thereupon Tests shall be undertaken in \naccordance with this Article 14. Such procedure shall be repeated as necessary \nuntil the defects or deficiencies are rectified.  \n \n14.5.2  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary c ontained in Clause 14.5.1, the \nAuthority may, at any time after receiving a report from the Independent \nEngineer under that Clause, direct the Independent Engineer to issue a \nProvisional Certificate under Clause 14.3, and such direction shall be complied \nforthwith.   \n \n14.6 Rescheduling of Tests  \nIf the Independent Engineer certifies to the Authority and the Concessionaire \nthat it is unable to issue the Completion Certificate because of events or \ncircumstances on account of which the Tests could not be held or  had to be \nsuspended, the Concessionaire shall be entitled to re -schedule the Tests and \nhold the same as soon as reasonably practicable.   \n62 \n ARTICLE 15  \nENTRY INTO COMMERCIAL SERVICE  \n \n15.1 Commercial Operation Date (COD)  \n15.1.1  [Six-Laning]  shall be deemed to be complete when the Completion Certificate, \nis issued under the provisions of Article 14 . The commercial operation date of \nthe Project shall be the Appointed date (the “ COD ”). The Project Highway \nshall enter into commercial service on COD whereupon the Co ncessionaire \nshall be entitled to demand and collect Fee in accordance with the provisions \nof Article 27.  \n \n15.2 Damages for delay  \n15.2.1  The Concessionaire hereby agrees and undertakes that itself shall achieve COD \nwithin 180 (One Hundred Eighty) days from  the  date of this Agreement and \nin the even t of delay , it shall be entitle d to a further period not exceeding 120 \n(One Twenty) days , subject to payment of Damage s to the Authority in a sum \ncalculated at the rate of 0.1%  (Zero point one per cent) of the Performance \nSecurity for each day of delay; provided that the Damage s specified herein \nshall be payable every week in advance and the period beyond the said 180 \n(One Hundred Eighty  ) days shall be gran ted only to the extent of Damages  so \npaid; provided furt her that  no Damage s shall be payable if such delay in COD \nhas occurred solely as a result of any default or delay by the Authority in \nprocuring satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent specified in Clause 4.1.2 of \ndue to Force Majeure.  \n \n15.2.2  The Concessionaire  shall , upon occurrence of COD, notify the Authority \nforthwith.   \n  \n63 \n ARTICLE 16  \nCHANGE OF SCOPE  \n \n16.1 Change of Scope  \n \n16.1.1  The Authority may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this \nAgreement, require the provision of additional works and services which are \nnot included in the Scope of the Project as contemplated by this Agreement \n(“Change of Scope ”). Any such Change of Scope shall be made in accordance \nwith the provisions of this Article 16 and the costs thereof shall be expended \nby th e Concessionaire and reimbursed to it by the Authority in accordance with \nClause 16.3.  \n \n16.1.2  If the Concessionaire determines at any time that a Change of Scope is \nnecessary for providing safer and improved services to the Users, it shall by \nnotice in wr iting require the Authority to consider such Change of Scope. The \nAuthority shall, within 60 (sixty ) days of receipt of such notice, either accept \nsuch Change of Scope with modifications, if any, and initiate proceedings \ntherefor in accordance with this Ar ticle 16 or inform the Concessionaire in \nwriting of its reasons for not accepting such Change of Scope.  \n \n16.2 Procedure for Change of Scope  \n \n16.2.1  In the event of the Authority determining that a Change of Scope is necessary, \nit shall issue to the Concess ionaire a notice specifying in reasonable detail the \nworks and services contemplated thereunder (the “ Change of Scope Notice ”). \n \n16.2.2  Upon receipt of a Change of Scope Notice, the Concessionaire shall, with due \ndiligence, provide to the Authority such in formation as is necessary, together \nwith preliminary Documentation in support of:  \n(a) the impact, if any, which the Change of Scope is likely to have on the \nProject Completion Schedule if the works or services are required to be \ncarried out during the Cons truction Period ; and \n(b) the options for implementing the proposed Change of Scope and the \neffect, if any, each such option would have on the costs and time \nthereof, including a detailed breakdown by work classifications \nspecifying the material and labour costs calculated in accordance with \nthe schedule of rates applicable  to the works assigned by the Authority \nto its contractors, along with the proposed premium/discount on such \nrates; provided that the cost incurred by the Concessionaire in \nproviding such information shall be reimbursed by the Authority to the \nextent such cost is certified by the Independent Engineer as reasonable.  \n  \n64 \n 16.2.3  Upon receipt of information set forth in Clause 16.2.2, if the Authority decides \nto proceed with the Change of Scope, i t shall convey its preferred option to the \nConcessionaire, and the Parties shall, with assistance of the Independent \nEngineer, thereupon make good faith efforts to agree upon the time and costs \nfor implementation thereof. Upon reaching an agreement, the Au thority shall \nissue an order (the “ Change of Scope Order ”) requiring the Concessionaire \nto proceed with the performance thereof. In the event that the Parties are unable \nto agree, the Authority may, by issuing a Change of Scope Order, require the \nConcessio naire to proceed with the performance thereof pending resolution of \nthe Dispute, or carry out the works in accordance with Clause 16.5.  \n \n16.2.4  The provisions of this Agreement, insofar as they relate to Construction Works \nand Tests, shall apply mutatis mu tandis  to the works undertaken by the \nConcessionaire under this Article 16.  \n \n16.3    Payment for Change of Scope  \n \n16.3.1  Within 30 (thirty ) days of issuing a Change of Scope Order, the Authority shall \nmake an advance payment to the Concessionaire in a sum equal to 20% (twenty \nper cent) of the cost of Change of Scope as agreed hereunder, and in the event \nof a Dispute, 20% (twenty per cent) of the cost assessed by the Independent \nEngineer. The Concessionaire shall, after commencement of work, present to \nthe A uthority bills for payment in respect of the works in progress or completed \nworks, as the case may be, supported by such Documentation as is reasonably \nsufficient for the Authority to determine the accuracy thereof. Within 30 \n(thirty) days of receipt of su ch bills, the Authority shall disburse to the \nConcessionaire such amounts as are certified by the Independent Engineer as \nreasonable and after making a proportionate deduction for the advance \npayment made hereunder, and in the event of any Dispute, final a djustments \nthereto shall be made under and in accordance with the Dispute Resolution \nProcedure.  \n \n16.3.2  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Clause 16.3.1, all costs \narising out of any Change of Scope Order issued during the Construction \nPeriod  shall be borne by the Concessionaire, subject to an aggregate ceiling of \n0.25% (zero point two five per cent) of the Total Project Cost. Any costs in \nexcess of the ceiling shall be reimbursed by the Authority in accordance with \nClause 16.3.1. In the event that the total cost arising out of Change of Scope \nOrders (if any) issued prior to the Project Completion Date is less than 0.25% \n(zero point two five per cent) of the Total Project Cost, the difference thereof \nshall be credited by the Concessionaire  to the Safety Fund within a period of \n180 (one hundred and eighty) days of the Project Completion Date.  For the \navoidance of doubt, it is agreed that the aforesaid 0.25% (zero point two five  \n65 \n per cent) of the Total Project Cost shall, to the extent borne b y the \nConcessionaire, be deemed to form part of the actual capital cost of the Project.  \n \n16.4 Restriction on certain works  \n \n16.4.1  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 16, the \nAuthority shall not require the Concessionaire to undertake any works or \nservices if such works or services are likely to delay completion of [Six-\nLaning]  ; provided that in the event that the Authority considers such works or \nservices to be essential, it may issue a Change of Scope Order, subject to the \ncondition that the works forming part of or affected by such Order shall not be \nreckoned for purposes of determining completion of [Six-Laning]   and issuing \nthe Provisional Certificate.  \n \n16.4.2  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Art icle 16, the \nConcessionaire shall be entitled to nullify any Change of Scope Order if it \ncauses the cumulative costs relating to all the Change of Scope Orders to \nexceed 5% (five per cent) of the Total Project Cost in any continuous period \nof 3 (three) yea rs immediately preceding the date of such Change of Scope \nOrder or if such cumulative costs exceed 20% (twenty per cent) of the Total \nProject Cost at any time during the Concession Period.  \n \n16.5 Power of the Authority to undertake works  \n \n16.5.1 Notwithstan ding anything to the contrary contained in Clauses 16.2 and 16.3, \nthe Authority may, after giving notice to the Concessionaire and considering \nits reply thereto, award such works or services to any person on the basis of \nopen competitive bidding; provided that the Concessionaire shall have the \noption of matching the first ranked bid in terms of the selection criteria, subject \nto payment of 2% (two per cent) of t he bid amount to the Authority$, and \nthereupon securing the award of such works or services. For the avoidance of \ndoubt, it is agreed that the  Concessionaire shall be entitled to exercise such \noption only if it has participated in the bidding process and its bid does not \nexceed the first ranked bid by more than 10% (ten percent) thereof.  \n \n16.5.2 The w orks undertaken in accordance with this Clause 16.5 shall conform to the \nSpecifications and Standards and shall be carried out in a manner that \nminimises the disruption in operation of the Project Highway. The provisions \nof this Agreement, insofar as they relate to Construction Works and Tests, shall \napply mutatis mutandis  to the works carried out under this Clause 16.5.  \n \n                                                      \n$ The Authority shall transfer 75% (seventy five per cent) of the amount so received to the first ranked \nbidder whose bid shall have been matched by the Concessionaire.   \n66 \n 16.6     Reduction in Scope of the Project  \n \n16.6.1  If the Concessionaire shall have failed to complete any Construction Works on \naccount of Force Majeure or for reasons solely attributable to the Authority, \nthe Authority may, in its discretion, require the Concessionaire to pay 80% \n(eighty percent) of the sum saved therefrom, and upon such payment to the \nAuthority, the obligations of the Co ncessionaire in respect of such works shall \nbe deemed to have been fulfilled.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that \nin the event such reduction in Scope of the Project causes or will cause a \nreduction in net after -tax return of the Concessionaire, the Parties shall meet, \nas soon as reasonably practical, and agree on a full or partial waiver of the \naforesaid payment of 80% (eighty per cent) so as to place the Concessionaire \nin the same financial position as it would have enjoyed had there been no \nreduction in Scope of the Project. It is further agreed that the liability of the \nAuthority under this Clause 16.6 shall not extend beyond waiver of the \naforesaid 80% (eighty per cent). It is also agreed that in the event of a dispute, \nthe Dispute Resolution Procedure shall apply.  \n \n16.6.2  For determining the obligations of the Concessionaire under this Clause 16.6, \nthe provisions of Clauses 16.1, 16.2 and 16.4 shall apply mutatis mutandis , and \nupon issue of Change of Scope Order by the Authority hereunder, the  \nConcessionaire shall pay forthwith the sum specified therein.   \n67 \n ARTICLE 17  \nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE  \n \n17.1     O&M obligations of the Concessionaire  \n \n17.1.1 During the Operation Period, the Concessionaire shall operate and maintain the \nProject Highway in a ccordance with this Agreement either by itself, or through \nthe O&M Contractor and if required, modify, repair or otherwise make \nimprovements to the Project Highway to comply with the provisions of this \nAgreement, Applicable Laws and Applicable Permits, and  conform to Good \nIndustry Practice.

The purpose of visual inspection is to report the \nobstacles to traffic, defects and deficiencies of pavement/structure, missing \nor damages to safety barrier (crash barriers) and traffic signs installed or  \n212 \n erect ed on highway. Such inspections should be done daily. The visual \ninspection may be carried out by visual assessment with careful \nobservation of the specific object/item of the Project Facilities for \nidentification and for quantification of the deficiencies  or damages of the \nProject Facilities. Geotagging Cameras and Distance Measuring Devices \nshall be used to update base asset performance parameters on daily basis. \nIf timely inspection and reporting of these safety related deficiencies are \nnot done, they co uld lead to accidents or severe maintenance problems.  \n \n(i) Close Inspection: Close inspections for assessment of \ndefects/deficiencies of Project Highway shall be periodic in nature and \nwould require detailed examination of all elements of the Project \nHighway. Close inspection may be visual or may involve investigations \nto be carried out using instruments.  The frequency of close inspections \nwould depend upon the nature of the elements of Project Highway. This \ninspection is to be carried out by the Highway/Bridg e Engineer having \ngood knowledge of Highway with theoretical background to analyse  \nthe nature, and extent of defects/deficiencies, suggest suitable remedial \nmeasures to rectify/remedy them and quantify repair work.  \n \n(ii) Thorough Inspection: A thorough inspecti on is comprehensive and \ndetailed assessment of defects/deficiencies of the Project Highway with \nthe aid of standard equipment and non -destructive testing. Such an \ninspection is to be carried out on the basis of comprehensive checklist \nof items related to t he materials, condition of element of Project \nHighway. A checklist is to be prepared well in advance of inspection. \nThe thorough inspection should be undertaken during the most critical \nweather condition. Thorough inspection carried out will offer the most  \ncritical evaluation of the performance of the Project Highway elements.  \n \nBesides being a qualified Highway/Bridge engineer, the inspection team \nleader must be familiar with design and construction features of the \nHighway /Bridges to be inspected so that t he condition can be properly and \naccurately assessed for a meaningful report and quantification of repair \nworks. The competence of team leader to recognize any structural \ndistress/deficiencies and assess its seriousness with complete \nrecommendation for app ropriate repairs are important pre -requisites for \nentrusting this assignment to him.  \n \nAfter thorough visual inspection and detailed condition survey of various \nbridge components at 5 years interval and also when whenever distress \nserious distress observed in the conditional survey following test shall need \nto be carried out:  \n  \n213 \n  \n \nS.

PROCEDURE FOR HARMONIOUS SUBSTITUTION OF \nCONCESSIONAIRE  \nFor the purpose of the harmonious substitution as detailed herein, an event of \n“Financial D efault” as defined shall be deemed to include situations where the \nAuthority and / or the Senior Lenders have reasons to apprehend, in their \nconsidered opinion, that the Concessionaire is likely to face financial distress \nand is likely to default in the co mpliance of the terms of the Concession. For  \n291 \n the purpose of the harmonious substitution as detailed herein, the term \n“Nominated Company” shall mean, wherever the Selected Bidder/Consortium \nMembers of the project SPVs/ are sought to be substituted, the curr ent SPV \ncompany itself.  \nParties therefore agree to following: - \n \n3A.1.  Provisions pertaining to substitution of the Concessionaire by the \nLenders Representative are contained in Article  40.3 read with the \nSubstitution Agreement set forth in Schedule -V and  Article  3.1.1 of the \nSubstitution Agreement in particular Article 3.2 and Article 3.3 of the \nSubstitution Agreement provide for substitution in the event of Financial \nDefault and Concessionaire’s Default respectively. It is further clarified that \nRight o f Substitution by the Lender’s Representative can be exercised in \nsituations other that those illustrated in Clause 3.2 and Clause 3.3 of the \nSubstitution Agreement. In cases of harmonious substitution as envisaged \nherein, the provisions contained in Artic le 3.4 of the Substitution Agreement \nshall be applicable, and in addition the procedure laid down hereunder shall be \napplicable.  \na. The Concessionaire shall make a written representation to the Lender’s \nRepresentative with a copy to the Authority requestin g the Lender’s \nRepresentative to seek approval of the Authority for Substitution. Upon \nreceiving the said request, the Lender’s Representative shall make its own \nassessment regarding the said request and upon being satisfied that it will be \nin the interest  of the Project that the Substitution be effected, Lender’s \nRepresentative in consultation with the Concessionaire would invite, negotiate \nand procure offers either by private negotiations or public auction or tenders, \nfor the said Substitution as defined herein.  \nb. Selection of the substitute (company or the Selected bidder/ Consortium \nMembers of such project SPV) and the valuation of the Equity of the \nConcessionaire would be determined by the Concessionaire and Lenders.  \nc. Upon receiving the proposal of t he Lender’s Representative, the Authority \nshall satisfy itself about the credentials of the Nominated Company or of the \nsubstitute to the Selected bidder/Consortium Members of such projects and \naccord its concurrence regarding such substitution considering  the following.  \ni. In the event that COD has been achieved, the substituting entity should have \nadequate experience of operating and maintaining completed road projects by \nitself or through its associates/subsidiaries.  \nii. In the event that COD is yet to b e achieved, the substituting entity should have \nthe requisite financial and technical qualifications to bid for a project of at least \nthe same size.  \nThereafter, (where the substitution entity is a new company), the nominated \ncompany will form an SPV for ta king over the project along with all the rights \nand obligations of the concessionaire under the Concession Agreement.  \nd. While concurring with the said proposal of the Lender’s Representative,  \n292 \n Authority, in its sole discretion, may levy an appropriate pena lty not exceeding \n1% (one per cent) of the Total Project Cost keeping in view the nature and \nextent of default as per the procedure to be prescribed for the purpose by the \nAuthority. Provided that no penalty shall be levied on the Concessionaire for \nnon-fulfilment of its obligations where the responsibility for delay in execution \nor completion for the project is on account of non -fulfilment or delay in \nfulfilment  of the obligations of the Authority, namely, land acquisition, \nenvironmental clearances, other statutory/regulatory approvals/ clearances, as \nthe case may be. The Authority shall cure such defaults before the signing of \nsubstitution agreement.  \ne. Subsequent to such substitution, the Concessionaire shall ensure compliance \nto the Article 5.3 and Artic le 7.1 (k) read with the definition of “Change in \nOwnership” under Article 48.  \nf. The Procedure prescribed under other Articles of the Concession Agreement \nand the Substitution Agreement, except to the extent of this harmonious \nsubstitution specified herei n, shall be applicable.  \ng. The Authority shall stand fully discharged of any claims whatsoever, by the \nexisting Concessionaire where the substitution entity is a new company.  \nh. Such substitution is permitted only once during construction Period  \n \n4 PROJECT  AGREEMENTS  \n \n4.1       Substitution of Nominated Company in Project Agreements  \nThe Concessionaire shall ensure and procure that each Project Agreement \ncontains provisions that entitle the Nominated Company to step into such \nProject Agreement, in its discre tion, in place and substitution of the \nConcessionaire in the event of such Nominated Company’s assumption of the \nliabilities and obligations of the Concessionaire under the Concession \nAgreement.  \n \n5 TERMINATION OF CONCESSION AGREEMENT  \n \n5.1 Termination upon occurrence of Financial Default  \nAt any time after issue of a Notice of Financial Default, the Lenders’ \nRepresentative may by a notice in writing require the Authority to terminate \nthe Concession Agreement forthwith, and upon receipt of such notice, the \nAuthority shall undertake Termination under and in accordance with the \nprovisions of Article 37 of the Concession Agreement.  \n \n5.2 Termination when no Nominated Company is selected  \nIn the event that no Nominated Company acceptable to the Authority is \nselected and recommended by the Lenders’ Representative within the period \nof 180 (one hundred and eighty) days or any extension thereof as set forth in \nClause 3.3.2, the Authority may terminate the Concession Agreement  \n293 \n forthwith in accordance with the provisions th ereof.  \n \n5.3 Realisation of Debt Due  \nThe Authority and the Concessionaire hereby acknowledge and agree that, \nwithout prejudice to their any other right or remedy, the Lenders’ \nRepresentative is entitled to receive from the Concessionaire, without any \nfurthe r reference to or consent of the Concessionaire, the Debt Due upon \nTermination of the Concession Agreement.

The code of conduct prescribed by the \nGoverning Body has to be adopted.  \nAppointment  \n15.1 A prospective arbitrator shall accept an appointment only if he i s fully satisfied that he \nis able to discharge his duties without bias, he has an adequate knowledge of the \nlanguage of the arbitration, and he is able to give to the arbitration the time and attention \nwhich the parties are reasonably entitled to expect,  \n15.2 In this code, the masculine includes the feminine.   \n320 \n Disclosure  \n15.3 A prospective arbitrator shall disclose all facts or circumstances that may give rise to \njustifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence, such duty to continue thorough \nout the arbitra l proceedings with regard to new facts and circumstances.  \n15.4 A prospective arbitrator shall disclose to the Secretary and any party who approaches \nhim for a possible appointment:  \n(a) Any past or present close personal relationship or business relationship, whethe r \ndirect or indirect, with any party to the dispute, or any representative of a party, \nor any person known to be a potentially important witness in the arbitration;  \n(b) The extent of any prior knowledge he may have of the dispute.  \nBias \n15.5 The criteria for assessi ng questions relating to bias are impartiality and independence. \nPartiality arises when an arbitrator favours one of the parties or where he is prejudiced \nin relation to the subject matter of the dispute. Dependence arises from relationships \nbetween an arb itrator and one of the parties, or with someone closely connected with one \nof the parties.  \n15.6 Any close personal relationship or current direct or indirect business relationship \nbetween an arbitrator and a party, or any representative of a party, or with a person who \nis known to be a potentially important witness, will normally give rise to justifiable \ndoubts as to a prospective arbitrator’s impartiality or independence. Past business \nrelationships will only give rise to justifiable doubts if they are of such magnitude or \nnature as to be likely to affect a prospective arbitrator’s judgment. He should decline to \naccept an appointment in such circumstances unless the parties agree in writing that he \nmay proceed.  \nCommunications  \n15.7 Before accepting an appointment, an arbitrator may only enquire as to the general nature \nof the dispute, the names of the parties and the expected time period required for the \narbitration.  \n15.8 No arbitrator shall confer with any of the parties or their Counsel until after the Secretary \ngives not ice of the formation of the Tribunal to the parties.  \n15.9 Throughout the arbitral proceedings, an arbitrator shall avoid any unilateral \ncommunications regarding the case with any party, or its representatives.  \nFees  \n15.10  In accepting an appointment, an arbitrator agr ees to the remuneration as prescribed in \nthe rules of SAROD, and he shall make no unilateral arrangements with any of the parties \nor their Counsel for any additional fees or expenses without the agreement of all the \nparties and the consent of the Secretary  of SAROD.  \nConduct  \n15.11  Once the arbitration proceedings commence, the arbitrator shall acquaint himself with \nall the facts and arguments presented and all discussions relative to the proceedings so \nthat he may properly understand the dispute.   \n321 \n Confidentiality  \n15.12  The arbitration proceedings shall remain confidential. An arbitrator is in a relationship \nof trust to the parties and should not, at any time, use confidential information acquired \nduring the course of the proceedings to gain personal advantage or advantag e for \nothers, or to affect adversely the interest of another.  \n15.13  This Code is not intended to provide grounds for the setting aside of any award.  \nRule 16 - Challenge of Arbitrators  \n16.1 An arbitrator may be challenged if there are circumstances that give rise to justifiable  \ndoubts as to his impartially or independence and also if he or she has committed any \nmisconduct.   \n16.2 An arbitrator may also be challenged if he does not possess the qualifications required \nby the agreement of the parties,  \n16.3 A party may challenge an a rbitrator appointed on its nomination or with its agreement \nonly for reasons of which it becomes aware after the appointment has been made.  \n16.4 A party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall file with the Secretary and serve \non the other party or all oth er parties, whichever is applicable, a Notice of Challenge.  \n16.5 The Notice of challenge must be filed and served within 14 days from the appointment \nof the arbitrator or within 14 days after the circumstances mentioned in Rule 15.1 \nbecame known to that party.  \n16.6 The Notice of Challenge must state the reasons for the challenge.  \n16.7 The arbitration shall be suspended until the challenge is resolved or decided upon.  \n16.8 When an arbitrator has been challenged by one party, the other party may agree to the \nchallenge. The arbit rator may also, after the challenge, withdraw from his office. \nHowever, it is not implied in either case that there has been an acceptance of the \nvalidity of the grounds for the challenge. In both cases, the procedure provided in \nRule 11 read with Rule 13,  shall be used for the appointment of a substitute arbitrator.  \nRule 17 - Decision on Challenge  \n17.1 If the other party does not agree to the challenge and the arbitrator does not withdraw, \nthe decision on the challenge will be made by the Governing Body.  \n17.2 If the  Governing Body sustains the challenge, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed \nor chosen pursuant to the procedure applicable to the appointment of an arbitrator as \nprovided in Rule 11 read with Rule 13. If the Governing Body dismisses the challenge, \nthe arbitrator shall continue with the arbitration.   \n322 \n Rule 18 - Removal of the Tribunal  \n18.1 The Governing Body may on the application of a party remove an arbitrator:  \na. Who is physically or mentally incapable of conducting the proceedings or \nwhere there are justif iable doubts as to his ability to do so; or  \nb.

If any other \narbitrator is replaced, such re-hearing may take place at the discretion of the \nTribunal.  \nRule 20 - Jurisdiction of the Tribunal  \n20.1 The Tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction, including any \nobjection wit h respect to the existence, termination or validity of the arbitration \nagreement. For that purpose, an arbitration agreement which forms part of a contract \nshall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A \ndecision by the T ribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure \nthe invalidity of the arbitration agreement.  \n20.2 The plea that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in \nthe Statement of Defense. A plea that the Tribunal is  exceeding the scope of its \nauthority shall be raised promptly after the Tribunal has indicated its intention to \ndecide on the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority. In either case \nthe Tribunal may nevertheless admit a late plea under this  Rule if it considers the \ndelay justified. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that he \nhas nominated, or participated in the appointment of an arbitrator.  \n20.3 The Tribunal must rule on an objection that it lacks jurisdiction as a prel iminary \nquestion upon the objection being raised. It may rule on an objection that it exceeds \nthe scope of its authority either as a preliminary question or in an award on the \nmerits, as it deems just and convenient.  \n20.4 In addition to the jurisdiction to exer cise the powers defined elsewhere in these \nRules, the Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to determine any question of law arising \nin the arbitration; proceed with the arbitration not with sanding the failure or refusal \nof any party to comply with these Rules  or with the Tribunal’s orders or directions, \nor to attend any meeting or hearing, but only after giving that party written notice \nthat it intends to do so; and to receive and take into account such written or oral \nevidence as it shall determine to be rele vant, whether or not strictly admissible in \nlaw. \n323 \n Rule 21 – Fees of SAROD and Arbitral Tribunal  \nFee Schedule  \nRegistration Fee (Non - Refundable): Rs, 10,000/ - or any amount fixed  by Governing \nBody from time to time.
