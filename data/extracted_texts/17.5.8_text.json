Even   some Honourable Members of Parliament have complained about misbehaviour by the staff at toll booths. Other persons whose vehicles are exempted from payment of fee (toll) according to the policy of the Government have also complained about misbehaviour of the staff at toll booths. Each notification for collection of fee includes a list of vehicles,  which are  exempted from paying fee (toll) This list is also required to be displayed at three places which are at a distance of   1OOm S0Om and 10OOm fom toll booths in Hindi, English and Iocal language by placing proper hoardings This must_be ensured Instructions have already been issued vide our letter No. 13013/50/02-03/CMD-COIVPP Ref: dated 2003 that Honourable Members of Parliament shall be  exempted from payment of  fee on production of their identity card issued by the Parliament: Display of Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha stickers on their cars is required This must be adhered to strictly by the concerned personnel deployed for fee collection. It is clariled that Jux vehicte in_which apHonourable_Member Members_oL_Parliiament js are travelling is_exempt_from payment ef user tee irrespective O the fact whether_the_vehicle belongs_to_the Honourable Meqber_g_Parliament ornot: Instances of misbehavior and unnecessary arguments on the part of personnel   engaged by the fee collecting agency adversely affect the image of NHAI as a user friendly professional organization which is most unwarranted It is expected that Project Directors will enquire into each such incident thoroughly and take firm  punitive action  against the  erring personnel in accordance with the contractual  agreement without  fail. It is equally important that persons posted at toll booth should be properly trained to be patient and unfailingly courteous in dealing with users of highways and under no circumstances misbehave with anyone. To ensure the same, following instructions are issued: - Fee   collecting   agencies   including O&M  Operator and DGR Sponsored  Ex- servicemen should be asked to train every person engaged by ther in the work of fee collection (not limited to booth operators) to induction and also subsequently at periodical intervals. Project Directors should ensure by periodic checks that such training is being imparted. Contd. 2/- Z:unmlohialneelamlvip doc N+A+ by 26t May pot prior",
