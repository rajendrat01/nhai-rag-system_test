As per  Significant Accounting Policies of NHAI, payments made to various Central & State Government departments and other Government Agencies for various works like shifting of utilities, tree cutting and compensatory afforestation, shifting of water pipelines, construction of ROBs, etc. for various projects and maintenance of highways to the State Government  departments are shown as 'Advance  against deposit works' and 'Advance for maintenance of highways' respectively Expenditure incurred  against  such advances based on the utilization statements  furnished by respective agencies is shown as Capital Work in Progress and as expenditure on maintenance of highways respectively. It is observed that Utilization Certificate in respect of such deposit work and advance   against maintenance work are not  received   timely resulting in delay in adjustment of advances and accounting of agency charges: This has also been raised by the Internal Auditors. A Committee constituted has examined the whole issue and based on the recommendation of the Committee, it is decided to adopt the following proceduresl policies on the subject:; Payments made for utility shifting to Govt: Deptt: Payments made to Government Departments as a composite amount consisting of the charges for utility shifting including supervision charges, the existing procedure of booking the amount in CWIP only after receipt of Utilisation Certificate may continue. However, where shifting of utilities are undertaken; by an agency (EPC contractor/  concessionaire) other than the Government Department; any payment made to the Government Department towards supervision/ agency charges, may be capitalized without   insisting upon the utilization certificate from the concerned department: Proper acknowledgement of such amount by the concerned Department may be treated as sufficient for booking the expenditure to the final head of account; In case there is   refund of the amount after  completion of the work, necessary adjustment should be made in the respective head of account: Payment made for ROB Payments for ROB are made based o the demand from Ministry of Railways In addition sometimes departmental charges are also claimed by railways All these codal charges are one-time payment and on fixed parameters: At the time of payment to Ministry of Railways, the expenditure may be booked to respeclive head of accounts (.e.g: CWIP ROB) on receipt of confirmation of the receipt of the payment from the Railways.
