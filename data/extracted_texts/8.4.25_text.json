No.1664) Sub: Policy circular for processing refinancing proposal for PPP Projects. The refinancing of PPP projects is governed by the terms of the Concession Agreements for specific project. The refinancing of the projects has linkage with the Debt Due and may impact the liabilities of the Authority in case of Termination of the project. 2 The   following clauses of the latest Model Concession Agreement, pertaining to refinancing, are reproduced below: Clause 5.2.3 of the Model Concession Agreement for BOT (Toll) projects: \"The Concessionaire shall not make any addition, replacement or amendments to any of the Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Authority if such addition, replacement or amendment has, or may have, the effect of   imposing or increasing any financial liability or obligation on the Authority, and in the event that any replacement or amendment is made without such consent, the Concessionaire shall not enforce such replacement or amendment nor permit enforcement thereof against the Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, the Authority acknowledges and agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold its consent for restructuring or rescheduling of the Debt Due. Clause 6.4 of the Model Concession Agreement of BOT (Toll) projects: \"Upon request made by the Concessionaire to this effect, the Authority shall, in conformity with any  regulations or guidelines that may be notified by the Government or the Reserve Bank of India, as the case may permit and enable the Concessionaire to secure refinancing, in whole or in part, of the Debt Due on such terms as may be agreed upon between the Concessionaireand the entity providing such refinancing; provided, however, that the refinancing hereunder shall be utilized for the project purpose only and shall always be subject to the approval of the Authority, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, the tenure of debt refinanced hereunder may be determined mutually between the Senior Lenders and the Authority, but the repayment thereof shall be completed no later than 1 (one) year prior to the expiry of Concession Period. 3_ In order to guard the probable increase in liability upon refinancing of a project, the matter has been deliberated in many Board Meetings of the Authority.
