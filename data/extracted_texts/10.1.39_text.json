No.167644)} Sub: Advisory regarding Acceptance Criteria where Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) work in Projects has already been executed or are under implementation reg: Several Projects_including Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway have been executed or are being executed using 50 mm SMA. The Pavements were designed as Perpetual Pavements (limiting the horizontal strain at the bottom of bottom bituminous layer to 80 micro-strain and the vertical strain on top of subgrade to 200 micro strain): This SOP is not applicable to SMA work completed and opened to traffic more than 2 years back and have been functioning well. 2  Issue related to Quality of SMA: 2.1 The SMA is being frequently in NH works as it is rut resistant and more durable. The life cycle cost and less maintenance consideration bring SMA as a favourite tool for Highway Construction. 2.2 However , it must also be ensured that the technology is implemented in a right manner, so that it can survive. SMA shall be used using Sound Engineering Practices. 2.3 SMA has a gap graded aggregate gradation. It has high percentage of coarse aggregates (more than 709) and aggregates should Angular Shape, Rough-Surfaced Texture, Strength and High Percentage of Fillers: 2.4 In past, some incidence have been reported regarding the deficiency in Quality of SMA of completed Projects. 3_ Investigation required to reassess the Quality of SMA: To ensure the Quality of SMA work, it has been decided to collect the core samples, conduct its testing from reputed lab and getting the test results analysed: The number, location and specific test requirements of Samples for each Project/Package are indicated as under: S.No. Location Number of of Sample Parameters required to be of Sample locations assessed RHS 1 full-depth core (150 Thickness, Bulk specific mm dia) of upto full Gravity of compacted depth of Bituminous sample (Gmb) and air  void material in the left of layer of bituminous wheel of each mix, (delamination signs lane. of stripping and other visible signs of distress to be noted for the core).
