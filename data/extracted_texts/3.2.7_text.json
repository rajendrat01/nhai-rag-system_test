Most of such debitlcredit advices relate to TADA claims of officers of HOlother PIUs, expenses incurred by one PIU on behalf of other PIU(s) and TDS(IT) effected by bank etc HQ is handling account of more than 100 PIUsICMUs ad responding to such huge number of advices at the fag end of the year becomes difficult, which could be avoided by following the procedure mentioned below: (1) TADA claims (a) The expenditure incurred by PIUs for inauguration Ceremony/Bhoomi Pujan , conducting meetings/seminars/ traininglworkshop etc based on approval of competent authority can be booked by PIU itself and no debit needs to be passed to HQ as it will not affect the overall account of NHAI: (b_ It has been observed that PIUs are incurring expenses, with approval of Competent Authority, towards hotel accommodation/traveling expenses etc  on official tour of VIPs and officials of Ministry visiting PIUs for NHAI activities. No debit needs be passed on to HQ as it will also not affect the overall account of NHAI; C TAJDA for HQ officers visiting PIUs however, should not be met by the PIUs, as has already been communicated vide Office Order No. NHAIIF&AFUNIPIUs/2001/151 dated 10.9.2001. In case of visits by the Chairman and Members, payment if required, may be made at PIUs and debit advice be sent to HQ for adjustment: (2) TDS (IT) There may be instances of income tax deductions at source on interest by bank and recovered by contractors. Such TDS is to be debited to HQ by PIUs, for accounting at HQ and claiming refund from Income Tax Department through annual income tax return; PIUs may maintain the details of such deductions and send the debit  advice to HQ along with original TDS certificate in Form No. 16A on yearly basis by 30th April after the close of the financial year. There should not be any lapse on this issue as we may not be able to claim refund from income tax authorities in absence of the TDS certificate: (3) Other DebitsiCredits Sometimes one PIU incurs expenses on behalf oflrelating to other PIUs. Similarly when projects are transferred from one PIU to other, project assets / liabilitieslexpenditures need to be transferred to the other PIUs. In such cases before raising debit through HQ, the concerned unit should forward all the supporting to the other unit and obtain credit notes for HQ. While raising debit to HQ, a copy of the said credit note may be submitted to HQ along with debit advice: Based on the debit and credit note of PIUs necessary entry will be passed at HQ. # & { # NHAL",
