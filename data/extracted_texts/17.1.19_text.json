This   delay causes financial   hardship to the collection agency. Due to non receipt of payment in time, the agencies are not able to pay the collection staff in time_ The delayed   payment of  salary, in addition to the violation of payment wages act also makes collection staff and collection agency vulnerable to malpractices revenue pilferage. We have been   emphasizing the compliance of our direction for   full / due payment to collection staff in time by account payee cheque.
