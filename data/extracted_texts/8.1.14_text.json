As per the current practice, the approval of Chairman is solicited at every stage of Pre-qualification of Bidders before inviting RFP. 2 Considering that soliciting approval of Chairman at each stage consumes a lot of time, as along taking into account the increasing mandate of NHAI; it has been decided to streamline the procedure, SO that the prequalification process is completed in least possible time: Accordingly: it has been decided to follow the   following procedure for pre-qualification of bidders: (_) For invitation of RFQ for a project, approval of Chairman shall be obtained on file_ (i) The constitution of the Evaluation Committee shall be approved at Member level. Short-listing of pre-qualified bidders, based on recommendation of the Evaluation Committee, shall be approved at the level of Member: iii) If there is a rejection/disqualification of any applicant or an issue of interpretation, the matter shall be placed in the immediate next Executive Committee Meeting for decision: 3 For all intermediate stages involved in RFQ bidders, the power for according approval are delegated to the concerned Members dealing with the project.
