During recent inspections, Chairman, NHAI has observed that the riding quality of the approaches of structures such as major bridges, minor bridges and slab culverts as also at the locations of expansion joints on the surface of deck slabs of major and minor bridges is poor. This not only brings discomfort to the road users but is also undesirable from the of view of road safety. The specifications for road and bridge works of the Ministry of Surface Transport (Roads Wing) which form the basis of works being carried out by NHAI clearly down the requirements/standards for carrying out such works, but it appears that due care is not being taken by the supervision personnel at the time of execution leading to the above short-comings. IRC-78 and Clause 305.4.4 of the Ministry's specifications for road and bridge works which specify the type of material, extent of backfill, its laying and compaction as also the methodology of construction to be adopted need to be followed scrupulously Similarly, clause 2603 of the Ministry's   specifications referred to above lays down the performance requirements of the expansion joints. Clause 2603.4 specifically deals with the performance requirement with respect to users. Apparently the work on the expansion joints is not being done as per the requirements laid down and is consequently resulting in a bumpy ride and poor performance with respect to user requirement: In view of the above, all PIUs and supervision consultants are advised to take utmost care while executing the above mentioned works so that quality of the desired level is achieved both on the approaches of road structures and at locations of expansion joints: are also advised to ensure that subsequent settlements at these locations or deterioration of riding   quality (which should not happen in the first place if the work is properly carried out ) are rectified  immediately on their occurrence and Contd._ 2/- LHUUw NHAL road point lay riding They got",
