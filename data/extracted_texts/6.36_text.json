No. 230259)} Sub: Implementation of NON SFS File Creation in E-Office System reg: E-office was introduced at NHAI in 2019 and has recently becn upgraded to version 7.3.4. Currently, there are over 1320 active users utilizing the €-office platform at NHAI: 2 In e-office, there are two options available for electronic file creation namely SFS (Single File System) and NON SFS (Non-Single File System) . Presently at NHAI, SFS is used for creation of e-files- The basic difference in the two file systems is as given below: (a) NON SFS is a standard system where the user selects the options given in the drop-down menu boxes. The file number created is as per the standard format chosen by the organisation. (b) In SFS, users are required to manually input file reference numbers for file creation, a process prone to huran error irrespective of adherence to a standard numbering format_ 3 Pursuant t0 directives issued during the EC meeting on 07.11.2023 , during which the IT division presented options for new file creation systems within the @-office ication and highlighted the benefits of adopting the NON SFS approach, all NHAI users are informed to exclusively adopt the NON SFS file creation method as per the prescribed standard formal: All Tech Divisions / Sections have been consulted and based on the information provided by them the e-office team has got the software amended through NIC. Accordingly, the implementation of NON SFS in the NHAI e-office instance is scheduled W.e.f 10.05.2024. Following this date, the option to create SFS files will be deactivated: 5. Post its implementation, free hand alphanumeric file numbering as being done now shall cease and the benefit will be that, if the file belongs to a highway project under any Tech Div., UPC No will automatically get embedded to file description under @-office which will make drastic change in creation, handling of e-files across all users in NHAI: 6.
