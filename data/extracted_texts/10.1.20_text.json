NHAI has been promoting use of Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) for collection of user fee (toll) and for enhancing the service level to the road users in payment of user fee at Toll Plazas. Accordingly, the need for increasing the number of lanes at toll plazas as well as upgradation of ETC infrastructure was felt: It was also contemplated to equip all the lanes at Toll Plazas with enabling facilities for use Of FASTags and pre-paid Smart Card Readers. 2 . The Policy Guidelines No.10.1.16/2017 dated 12.06.2017 dealing with preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) provide that the minimum number of toll lanes at any toll plaza would be not less than 4 times the numbers of lanes for which the highway is designed and all the lanes have to be designed/ equipped with ETC systems: Further, then Chairman, NHAI vide his DO letter dated 26.12.2016 (Annex-A) suggested that minimum number of toll lanes on toll plazas with enabling facilities for use of FASTags and pre-paid Smart Card Readers should be in the ratio of 1.4 for enhancing the service level to road users in payment of user fee_ 3 Though above guidelines are suggestive in nature, in some of the ongoing contracts, a decision for increasing the toll lanes was taken by the field offices and implemented without  examining the relevant aspects such as actual traffic on ground, land, other features, etc_ for  specific Toll Plaza. This has resulted in demand for Change of  Scope (COS) by the Contractors/ Concessionaires and approval of ex-post facto approval of COS thereon: While dealing with one such case for ex-post facto approval, Competent Authority directed to frame the guidelines to deal with such matters/CoS. 4_ Accordingly, with the approval of the Competent Authority, the following guidelines/ procedure shall be adopted for determining the number of toll lanes which are required to be constructed by the Contractor/ Concessionaire in terms of the provisions in the Agreement and additional lanes qualifying for COS: (i) The Traffic   Survey for base line date should be  conducted as per IRC guidelines and it shall be verified by the IEIAE: The Traffic Survey conducted by IHMCL may also be used for verification and comparison. (ii) The traffic should be projected for 20 years for designing the Toll Plazas as specified under clause 10.4.12 of Manuals of Specifications & Standards for 4-laning (IRC-SP: 84-2014) and Manual of Specifications & Standards for 6- laning (IRC: SP: 87-2013)_ For this purpose, the traffic growth shall be considered as adopted in DPR or 5% growth per annum, whichever is higher. The effect of additional induced traffic due to development of any new additional facility in future may also be considered. RT R NHAI",
