Bureau of Indian Standards has changed the grading of bitumen from penetration grade to viscosity grade with publication of IS 73.2006 (Paving Bitumen Specification Third Revision). The   viscosity  grade bitumen has been classified into   following 4 categories: VG-10 with minimum absolute viscosity of 800 Poises at 60*C VG-20 with minimum absolute viscosity of 1600 Poises at 60'C VG-30 with minimum absolute viscosity of 2400 Poises at 60\"C iv) VG-40 with minimum absolute viscosity of 3200 Poises at 60*C Considering the revision in IS.73, Ministry of   Shipping, Road   Transport & Highways vide letter No_ RWINH-33041/3/2001-S&R(R)-Vol.III dated 4.8.2008 (copy enclosed) has issued guidelines_regarding selection of an appropriate grade of bitumen based upon the viscosity grade. These guidelines are as under: VG-10 grade may be used in place of 80-100 penetration grade bitumen VG-2O grade may be considered for special cases only. VG-30 grade may be used in place of 60-70 penetration grade bitumen. VG-40 grade may be used in place of 30-40/40-50 penetration grade bitumen; In view of above all the future projects may provide for viscosity grade bitumen subject to availability: For ongoing projects, possibility of use of equivalent viscosity grade bitumen may be explored depending upon the availability.
