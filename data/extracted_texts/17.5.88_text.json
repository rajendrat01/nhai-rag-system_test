No. 248081)} Sub: Implementation of ETC system and OGM Services at NH Fee Plazas through System Integrators empanelled with IHMCL -reg: Ref: NHAI Policy Circular No 17.5.83/2022 dated 17.01.2022(copy enclosed) The Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) infrastructure at NH Toll Plaza is implemented and maintained by Info-tech companies known as System Integrators. Under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) Program there are uniform guidelines for ETC infrastructure, communication protocols, banking integration etc. Hence there is a need to engage experienced and competent agencies that rigorously adhere to these guidelines. 2_ IHMCL empanels System Integrators through careful evaluation of their experience and expertise. While applying for empanelment, the System Integrators provide unconditional and unqualified acceptance of all terms and conditions outlined in the Request For Empanelment (RFE) document, encompassing specifications for ETC equipment, SLA parameters, Internet Connectivity, and more: 3_ To ensure that Sls appointed at all NH Toll Plazas are obligated to adhere to all the guidelines, empanelment conditions and other NETC guidelines issued from time to time, NHAI issued   Policy Circular No 17.5.83/2022 dated 17.01.2022 which mandated that implementation of ETC system at NH Fee plazas  shall be carried out through System Integrators empanelled by IHMCL only. Concerned Concessionaires/EPC Contractors shall henceforth select any empanelled System Integrator only for any new project/contract for ETC infrastructure installation and /or for extending any existing contract for O&M services. 4 During the scrutiny of System Integrators deployed at NH Toll Plazas, it was observed that in contravention of above Policy Circular, many Contractors/Concessionaires have appointed System Integrators which are not empanelled with IHMCL. This has resulted in non-adherence of guidelines, protocols by many such agencies: 5 In order to further ensure that only empanelled System Integrators are onboarded at Toll Plazas it has been decided to follow following SOP while appointing System Integrator at Toll Plazas of any EPC/HAM/BOT /TOT 'InvlT Project: Sl No ActivitylAction Action by For appointment of System Integrator(s) at EPC Contractor the Toll Plaza(s) of the Project, the EPC Concessionaire IContractor Concessionaire of the Project, Iduring the Development Design phase, Ishall submit   three names of the System IIntegrators to the PD out of the empanelled list of System Integrators of IHMCL Contd_2I- T7m NHAI May,",
