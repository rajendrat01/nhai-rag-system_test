This has to stop immediately. 2 In future, the stipulated land will be acquired and handed over encumbrance free & hindrance free to the Contractor/ Concessionaire in time, or that part of the project will be descoped, or the project will be cancelled, if the land is not handed over, but in no case this issue will be kept pending, which will later on lead to huge claims/ arbitration/ litigation, which will end Up in huge financial loss to NHAI . 3_ From now onwards, every PD will daily devote adequate time to the issue of acquisition of land and handing over to the Contractor/ Concessionaire, till 100% land in every project is handed over. PD will also fill data in Data Lake/ PMS Portal; RO will daily monitor every PDs progress in this matter; Concerned CGM(T) & Member will monitor the progress twice a week and brief Chairman once a week about the progress of each project. 4. This task must be given priority by PDs and all concerned officers of PIU and RO. Most strict action will be taken if the remaining land is not handed over in the minimum possible time by making daily efforts. 5 Also, the Appointed Dates of the projects, henceforth, may be declared only after the Contractor/ Concessionaire certifies about the availability of un-encumbered & unhindered length in the prescribed format.
