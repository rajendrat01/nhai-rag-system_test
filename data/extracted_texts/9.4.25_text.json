Earlier, \ncriteria like net worth, experience etc. used to be prescribed. Based on experience and \nin consultation with concerned departments, Government has decided to prescribe the \nfollowing additional criteria for the qualification/ disqualification of the parties seeking \nto acquire stakes in public sector enterprises through disinvestment:  \n(a) In regard to matters other than the security and integrity of the country, \nany conviction by a Court of Law or indictment/ adverse order by a \nregulatory authority that casts a doubt on the ability of the Bidder to \nmanage the public sector unit when it is disinvested, or which relates to a \ngrave offence would constitute disqualificati on. Grave offence is defined to \nbe of such a nature that it outrages the moral sense of the community. The \ndecision in regard to the nature of the offence would be taken on case to \ncase basis after considering the facts of the case and relevant legal \nprinc iples, by the Government of India.  \n(b) In regard to matters relating to the security and integrity of the country, \nany charge -sheet by an agency of the Government/ conviction by a Court of \nLaw for an offence committed by the bidding party or by any sister conc ern \nof the bidding party would result in disqualification. The decision in regard \nto the relationship between the sister concerns would be taken, based on \nthe relevant facts and after examining whether the two concerns are \nsubstantially controlled by the s ame person/ persons.  \n(c) In both (a) and (b), disqualification shall continue for a period that \nGovernment deems appropriate.  \n(d) Any entity, which is disqualified from participating in the disinvestment \nprocess, would not be allowed to remain associated with it o r get \nassociated merely because it has preferred an appeal against the order \nbased on which it has been disqualified. The mere pendency of appeal will \nhave no effect on the disqualification.  \n(e) The disqualification criteria would come into effect immediately and would \napply to all Bidders for various disinvestment transactions, which have not \nbeen completed as yet.

The interested \nparties would be required to provide the information on the above criteria, \nalong w ith their Expressions of Interest (EOI). The Bidders shall be required \nto provide with their EOI an undertaking to the effect that no investigation \nby a regulatory authority is pending against them. In case any investigation \nis pending against the concern or its sister concern or against its CEO or any \nof its Directors/ Managers/ employees, full details of such investigation \nincluding the name of the investigating agency, the charge/ offence for \nwhich the investigation has been launched, name and designatio n of \npersons against whom the investigation has been launched and other \nrelevant information should be disclosed, to the satisfaction of the \nGovernment.

Performance Measures and Indicators  \nThe Contact assignment needs to meet the strategic objectives of the Employer. To \nensure this is achieved, The Contract include two classes of performance measures, \nnamely Operational Performance Measures (OPM’s)  and Management Performance \nMeasures (MPM’s) : \n \n Operational Performance Measures  relate directly to the quality of the road and \ntherefore to the results of the Contractor‟s maintenance activities. The required \nminimum acceptable road conditions and Service Levels are defined through the OPM‟s, \nand th ese are used to define and measure the compliance of the Contractor with the \nspecified requirements. The defined Operational Performance Measures and indicators \nare thus the accepted minimum thresholds  for the quality levels of the roads for which \nthe Cont ractor is responsible.    \n Management Performance Measures describe contractual requirements that are \nnot directly related to road conditions and performance. Most MPM‟s relate to \ninformation that the Contractor needs to deliver to the Employer, so that the Employer \ncan control certain aspects of the contract and the road asset, to operate its Road \nAsset Management  System – RAMS (if such a system exists) and to facilitate the \npreparation of the next contracts for the roads.  The contract also defines  MPM \nrequirements to include activities such as: (i) delivery of va rious types of reports to the \nEmployer; (ii) inventory updates and other data sharing requirements; and, (iii) \nmaintenance history (so subsequent tenderers can price the work).  \nThe OPMs cover essential aspects of the roads and take account of the fact that  \ndifferent roads within the contract area might require different Service Levels. Each \ncontract will be unique as the OPMs reflect the Employer‟s strategic goals for the \nspecific roads covered by the contract.  \nFor paved roads , OPM criteria refer mostly to Road User Service and Comfort measures, \nwhich can be expressed in terms such as:  \n Road Roughness  \n Road and lane width  \n Rutting  \n Vegetation control  \n Cleanliness of the road and its Right -of-way \n Visibility of road signs and markings  \n Availability of traffic lanes for vehicle traffic  \n Response times to rectify defects  \n Maintenance of other Road assets including utility / ATMS services \nrequired for proper operation of Traffic management and Road Safety  \n \n2. Services under this Contract  \nUnder this contract, the Contractor would be responsible to provide maintenance \nservice, periodical maintenance, and execute work orders for emergency works. \nMaintenance Service would have two parts the first one Routine Maintenance Services \nwhich would be paid in the form of the amount of the monthly lump -sum payment as \nper the rate quoted by the bidder according to the conditions of contract; second part Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n135 \n of maintenance service include Initial Rectification Works, which would mainly be paid \nin the form of a lump -sum amount while indicating the quantities of measurable \noutputs (completed per km length) to be executed in order that the road achieves the \nperformance standards;  \n \nPeriodic Maintenance Works, for specified section would be paid in the form of lump -\nsum r ate/ amount per km completed length that will be measured and paid in \naccordance with the progress in the execution of those measured outputs (completed \nper km length). Periodic Maintenance works also includes Road Markings, provision of \nreflective Road St uds, Gravel filling to match the Shoulder level with carriageway after \nlaying renewal coat, which will be paid on measured inputs basis.  \n \nUnit prices are provided for Emergency Works in the form of a Schedule of Prices. \nPayments will be made for each Emer gency on a case -to-case basis, on actual execution \nand value determined by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer/ Employer on \nthe basis of the quantities executed.  \n  \n \n2.1.

Periodic Maintenance (PM) Works  \n \n Periodic Maintenance works are the pavement resurfacing activities that are \nbeyond Routine Maintenance Activities.  Entire Project Section, if  specifically \nmentioned by Employer to be covered under Periodic Maintenance under this contract , \nshall be provide d with a renewal coat within the timeline specified by the Engineer/ \nEmployer but in any case, before completion of 02 Years from the start date of the \nwork unless otherwise decided by the Employer. However, in case the roughness of the \nroad is within the specified service level, the PM works can be deferred to be \ncompleted before expiry of fourth year from start date. Such deferment shall be \napproved by Engineer only after analysing the latest NSV survey report. The Defect \nLiability Period (DLP) for such w orks will be for the remaining Contract Duration or 36 \nmonths from the date of completion of such work items whichever is later. In case of \nfailure of Contractor to execute Periodic Maintenance work items within two/four \nyears (as the case may be) from the  start date of Contract, Liquidated damages shall \nbe paid by the Contractor. If Contractor fails to complete the PM works even beyond \n100 days after 2/4 years of start of work, then Employer will initiate action for \ntermination of contract by giving suitab le cure period notice and work shall be \nexecuted at the risk and cost of the contractor through third party.  \n \nThe periodic maintenance activities have to be carried out in order to restore the \nproject condition to meet all the relevant standards. The Contr actor is to make an \nestimate of the Periodic Maintenance Work quantities including camber/profile \ncorrections, which in his view are necessary to bring the roads to the required service \nlevel (Roughness Index) and include the cost for those works in the it em for Periodic \nMaintenance Works.   The Contractor would need to plan the periodic maintenance to \nensure that at the time of handover the remaining life of the road sections are \nmeeting the requirements mentioned in this contract. Prior to commencement of  an \noverlay, the Contractor is to notify the Engineer of the impending commencement of \nthe Works for inspection in accordance with the General Conditions.  \n \n If it is felt that IR works is not sufficient to being the road to the service level \ncondition wit h due satisfaction of the Engineer and employer, then PM works may be \ncarried out within the 6 months period also with prior approval of the Engineer.

The contractor will need to assess the current road conditions and \ndetermine what works are needed to meet the intervention criteria service levels, \nhowever for avo idance of any doubt, contractor has to execute the above minimum \nwork under PM.  \nNote 2: In case of rigid pavement, an overlay may be considered either partially \nbonded overlay or   fully bonded overlay subject to fulfilment of overlays \nrequirement as per p ara 11.6 of IRC: SP:83 -2018.  \n \nThe performance Criteria for Periodic Maintenance shall meet all the requirements of \na newly laid pavement in respect of user comfort and quality of pavement and \nshoulders as per relevant MoRTH specifications.   \n \nThe Roughness is to be measured at the beginning of the Contract as part of the Initial \nRoad Condition Report to confirm the sections that do not meet this Service Level \ncriteria.   \nOn completion of each milestone, the roughness shall be taken as part of t he Milestone \nReport.   \n \nIf the measurement reveals that the road roughness is above the Service Level, the \nEngineer will establish a time frame for the Contractor to complete periodic \nmaintenance works. That time frame should normally ensure that the corre sponding \nworks are completed within four months. The Engineer may however grant a longer \nperiod if, in the opinion of the Engineer, the circumstances warrant such longer \nperiod. Upon completion of the non -conforming section the relevant section roughness \nshall be measured again to confirm compliance.

The length of those roads or road sections must \ncorrespond to at least the percentage of the network indicated in the Table below for \nthat month. During such gradual compliance of OPMs, the payment for Routine \nMaintenance s hall be made corresponding to percentage compliance achieved in the \nOPMs, i.e. if 70% compliance of OPMs is achieved in the first month, then only 70% \npayment for routine maintenance shall be payable.

If for any \nroad there is no reliable data on its pa vement structure, the deflection measurements \nshall be complemented with pavement structure data obtained by trial pits everyone 5 km \nto evaluate pavement construction and subgrade conditions. Output of the deflection \nmeasurements shall be the basis for th e calculation of the residual life of the pavement in \nyears, based on the expected total number of typical standard axles.  \nMeasurement shall be by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD - Impulse Load Device). The \nFWD shall be equipped with air and surface temp erature sensors and a GPS location \ndevice. The equipment to be used by the Contractor must be approved by the Engineer.  \nDeflection measurements shall be taken at 200m intervals for each traffic lane throughout \nthe paved network or as specified in IRC: 115.  \nRequirement for measuring road roughness:  The Contractor shall measure the road \nroughness in terms of the International Roughness Index (IRI) or Bump Integrator (BI). The \ndata is needed by the Employer for use under his Road Asset Management System and by  \nthe Contractor for planning any needed interventions on the road. The equipment and data \nrequired must comply to the following standards:  \n \nClass 1 Profilometer: ASTM E950(98):2004 -Standard Test Method for measuring Longitudinal \nProfile of travelling surfa ces with accelerometer established inertial profiling reference  Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n181 \n ASTM E 1656 -94:2000 -standard guide for classification of automatic pavement condition \nsurvey equipment  \n \nThe measure of roughness is to be made in a continuous way in the wheel tracks of each \nlane of the carriageway. The measuring equipment must be calibrated/validated as per \nthe manufacturer‟s recommendations and further calibration using several reference r oad \nsections is also to be carried out in coordination with the Engineer. All roughness \nmeasurements shall be executed under the supervision of the Engineer, utilizing a Class 1 \nprecision Profile (ASTM E -950). They shall be reported as Bump Integrator (BI)  in mm/km.  \n \n5.1.2.  Road Furniture Condition Survey  \nThis survey will record all existing road furniture and its current condition. It will cover \nall types of road furniture, such as horizontal and vertical traffic signs, guardrails, safety \nbarriers and any other road safety equipment, traffic signals, road and street lighting, \nelectrical installations, and equipment, etc.  It will highlight any defects requiring \nreplacement or repair and will also indicate all cases and locations where road furniture \nshould be pre sent according to applicable norms and legislation, but is in fact absent.  \n \n5.1.3.  Cross Drainage  and other structure’s Condition Survey  \nFor all Cross Drainage and other structures , the condition surveys to be conducted must \nbe based on a v isual inspection for evaluating and rating their structural and functional \ncondition, and describing existing defects and shortcomings  particularly the bearings, \nexpansion joints, s lope protection works and scoring around pillars if any . Use of MBIU is \nmandatory wherever neces sary is mandatory.  \n \n5.2. Design Reports  \nEmergency Works, Design Reports are also required, unless the corresponding Work Order \nstates otherwise. The Design Report shall accompany any engineering design elaborated \nand submitted for approval.

The quality and the on -time \nsubmission of the Design Report is a Management Performance Measure (MPM).  \n \n5.3. Monthly Compliance Tables for Maintenance Services  \nAs described elsewhere in the contract, the Contract or‟s Self -Control Unit shall \ncontinuously verify the Contractor‟s own compliance with the Service Level and other \nrequirements. On the last working day of each calendar month, the Contractor‟s Self \nControl Unit shall submit to the Employer the Monthly Comp liance Tables for Maintenance \nServices for the same calendar month, reflecting road conditions and the Contractor‟s \ncompliance with Service Level requirements at the end of the month. The Monthly \nCompliance Tables for Maintenance Services are the basis for  the monthly Formal \nInspection and for the part of the Contractor‟s Monthly Statement which relates to \nMaintenance Services. The Monthly Compliance Tables for Maintenance Services shall be \ncomprised of:   \n Standardized EXCEL tables in a format to be approved by the Engineer, showing \nseparately for each road or road section the degree of compliance with Service Level \nrequirements, representing accurately the situation at the end of the previous \ncalendar month , and identifying any non -compliances that may exist.   \n A brief description of the most important maintenance activities carried out during \nthe month, including the locations.  Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n182 \n  Information on any formal complaints received and how these were responded to (if \napplicable).  \n Details of any major vehicle accidents that have occurred on project roads, in \nparticular of all accidents involving death or injury (if applicable).  \nThe quality and the on -time submission of the Monthly Compliance Tables for Maintenance \nServices is a Management Performance Measure (MPM).  \n \n \n5.4. Monthly Progress Report for Works  \nThis is the Contractor‟s monthly report on the progress of Rectification and Emergency \nWorks carried out. It shall be the basis for the part of the Contractor‟s Monthly  Statement \nwhich relates to those works. Submission of the Monthly Progress Report shall be a \nprerequisite for the acceptance of a payment claim for Initial Rectification, periodic \nmaintenance and Emergency Works. The Monthly Progress Report shall describe  the works \nexecuted during the month, as well as the Quality and Quantity Control procedures applied \nand their results (testing, etc).  \nThe Monthly Progress Report shall also cover the Contractor‟s activities in response to \ncontractual requirements for (i)  environmental and social safeguards, and (ii) occupational \nhealth and safety. The Monthly Progress Report for any month must be submitted by the \n10th calendar day of the following month as a supporting document to the Monthly \nStatement which is due on the  same day.  \nThe minimum information that the Monthly Progress Report must include is as follows:  \n A description of the Progress achieved during the preceding month of all rectification \nand Emergency Works, framed so as to enable the verification of any work  to be \nclaimed for payment.  \n The proposed Interim Payment Certificate (IPC) for rectification and Emergency Works.  \n All required Quality and Quantity Control reports on the works completed during the \nmonth clearly indicating, if applicable, any non -conforman ces with the Contractor‟s \nQuality Assurance Plan or any other requirements.  \n Copies of correspondence between the Contractor and other agencies, if any.  \n Minutes of all meetings held during the month between the Contractor and Employer \nand with any other sta keholders, including also the status of actions taken on \ncomplaints received and grievances brought forward at such meetings, if any.  \n Detailed information on the Contractor‟s activities in response to contractual \nrequirements for (i) environmental and soci al safeguards, and (ii) occupational health \nand safety.  \n The status of all grievances that have been submitted to the Contractor, along with \nresolution rates.  \n \n5.5. Road Asset Damage Reporting  \nThe Contractor shall report to the Employer any event such as vehicle accident, theft, act \nof vandalism, third -party intervention or any other event having caused damage to the \nroad assets and requiring repairs or replacement. The report may have the form of a letter \nto the Employer and shall be submitted within 96 h ours of occurrence of the event, or of \nthe Contractor having gained knowledge of such event. The report shall  \n describe the event and its circumstances;  \n describe the nature and extent of damage to road assets, including photographs;  Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n183 \n  cost estimate & timeline  for repair/replacement of the damages asset (at no extra \ncost to employer);  \n describe the actions taken by the Contractor, such as inspections and investigations \ncarried out, notifications made to the police and to other relevant authorities;  \n Recommend mea sures to be taken to avoid similar events in the future.  \nFor damages not already repaired by the Contractor, the Contractor shall propose the \nneeded repairs, including any designs if necessary, and a program for carrying out the \nrepairs.  \nIt is also the C ontractor‟s responsibility to report any event or incident of this nature to \nthe relevant authorities (Police, local Municipality and/or other public authorities \nconcerned) as soon as possible and to follow up on any actions taken by the police or other \nrelevant public authorities. If the damage is caused by third party intervention on the \nroad, the Contractor must also actively try to stop such intervention by informing the \nintervening party in writing (or verbally if writing is not feasible) of the damage  being \ncaused and the potential physical and legal consequences of the intervening party‟s action.  \n The Contractor‟s risk limitation for bearing the cost of necessary repairs after such \nevents shall be upto the limit of Insurance as stated in the Clause 11 of Contract \nData.  Repairs beyond such limit of the Insurance amount as stated in the Contract \nData are the Employer‟s Risk, provided that the Contractor has performed his \nobligations as described above. In such cases the Contractor shall submit to the \nEmployer a cost estimate with a breakdown of the cost for repair. The Employer \nmay instruct the Contractor to repair the damage under a Change Order or a Work \nOrder, as Emergency Works.  \n \nThe quality and the on -time submission of the “Road Asset Damage Report ” is a \nManagement Performance Measure (MPM).  \n \n5.6.  Work Completion Reports  \nThere is a two -step process for completing and handing over the Works by the Contractor \nto the Employer:  \n Substantial completion:  The first step is the “Taking -Over” of the Works by the \nEmployer, which is meant to occur when the works are “substantially completed” \nand can be used safely for the intended purpose, and opened for traffic without \nrisks of damage to the road structure or  to road users. The Defects Liability Period \nstarts at the time when the Contractor notifies “substantial completion” of the \nworks to the Engineer, unless the Employer objects in writing to “Substantial \nCompletion” having been achieved. After the “Taking -Over” is formalized through \nthe issuance of the “Taking -over Certificate” by the Employer, the first half of the \nRetention Money is to be released to the Contractor by the Employer.  \n Certificate of Completion:  The second step is the end of the Defects Liabil ity \nPeriod which will normally trigger the release of the second half of the Retention \nMoney to the Contractor by the Employer, provided that the Contractor has \npresented a “Full Works Completion Report” and the Employer has issued the \n“Certificate of Comp letion”, as described further below.   \nAt the time of “Substantial Completion”, the Contractor is required to issue a “Substantial \nCompletion Report”. This report shall include those parts of the information required (and \nlisted below) for the “Full Works Completion Report” which are already available at the \ntime of substantial completion. The “Substantial Completion Report” shall also list the Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n184 \n items that are yet to be completed by the Contractor (“ snag list ”). It must be part of the \nContractor‟s application for the Taking -Over of the works by the Employer as per GC 48.   \nWhen the Contractor has addressed all items on the “snag list”, he shall inform the \nEmployer through an official letter. Not later than 28 days afterwards the Contractor must \npresent a “Full Works Completion Report” and may also request the “Certificate of \nCompletion”. The Employer shall review the Full Works Completion Report. The Certificate \nof Completion cannot be issued if the Full Works Completion Report has not been \nsubmitted by the Contractor and accepted by the Engineer . \nThe “Full Works Completion Report” is essentially a supplement to the “Substantial \nCompletion Report”. It must present the information listed below, except those parts  \nwhich have already been included in the “Substantial Completion Report” for the same \nWorks. The “Full Works Completion Report” may make reference to the “Substantial \nCompletion Report” previously issued by the Contractor, for all the information, which wa s \nalready presented there, without having to present it again.  \nThe Full Works Completion Report shall include as a minimum:  \n Site location and details;  \n Construction start and end dates;  \n As built Drawings and photographs;  \n Details of all Quality and Quantity Control measures carried out by the Contractor;  \n Details of any works carried out after substantial completion to remedy pending items \non the “snag list”;  \n Design Calculations;  \n Topography survey results;  \n Setting out data and control points;  \n Hydrology of the  site (if applicable);  \n Structures; description of original and rehabilitated condition, (if applicable);  \n Pavement design and results of IRI measurements, (if applicable);  \n Geology and Geotechnical features (if applicable);  \n Environment Management Compliance Report; and  \n Summary of future inspection and maintenance requirements e.g. required frequency \nof inspections, environmental monitoring needs, specific routine, and periodic \nmaintenance needs, etc.  \n \nThe Employer shall review the “Substantial Completion Repo rt” and the “Full Works \nCompletion Report” within 14 days after receipt and provide comments, if any. If there are \ncomments requiring changes to the Report, a revised Report shall be submitted by the \nContractor within 14 days of receiving the comments. The  “Certificate of Completion”, \nwhich is a prerequisite for the repayment of the second half of the retention money at the \nend of the Defects Liability Period, cannot be issued if the Full Works Completion Report \nhas not been submitted and approved .  \n \n5.7. End of  Contract – Handover Report  \nThe Contractor must provide an End of Contract Handover Report on the first day of the \nsixth month prior to the end of the Contract. The purpose of the Handover Report is to \nprovide a smooth transition to the next contract and e nsure that the next Contractor and \nthe Employer are aware of any outstanding issues. The handing over report will be subject \nto verification of details of work completed vis -à-vis Contract scope by the Third Party \nAgency to be engaged by the Authority for the purpose. This report shall provide:  Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n185 \n For the contract as a whole:   \nA summary of the activities carried out (works and services), outcomes achieved, lessons \nlearnt, suggested good practices and recommendations to the Employer for improvements \nfor any fut ure maintenance contracts covering the same roads.  \nFor each road included in the contract:  \n(i) A history of the works carried out during the contract period; this shall include \ninformation on:  \n Site location and details  \n Construction start and end dates;  \n As built Drawings and photographs  \n Details of all Quality Control Tests  \n Design Calculations  \n Topography survey results  \n Setting out data and control points  \n Hydrology of the site  \n Structures; original and rehabilitated condition  \n Pavement design  \n Traffic data, if  available  \n Geology  \n Geotechnical features  \n Environmental and Social issues encountered and how they were dealt with  \n Summary of future inspection and maintenance requirements e.g., required \nfrequency of inspections, on -going environmental monitoring needs, sp ecific on -\ngoing maintenance needs etc.  \n(ii) A brief description of the current condition of the road, including the expected \nremaining service life of the pavement, and  \n(iii) Suggestions on the works that are considered necessary to be executed in the nex t \nyears in order to keep the road asset at the same Service Level. The assessment of the \npavement residual life of the contract roads must be supported by information on the \nresults of the pavement deflection and roughness (IRI) surveys executed during the  \ncontract.  \nThe quality and the on -time submission of the “End of Contract - Handover Report” is a \nManagement Performance Measure (MPM).  \n \n5.8. Project’s Final Completion Report  \nOn completion of the entire Contract and after the end of any remaining Defects Liability \nPeriod for works or parts thereof, the Contractor shall prepare a Final Completion Report \nwhich will essentially be an updated version of the End -of-Contract Handover  Report \ndescribed in the previous section, including any additional information which has become \navailable since the issuing of the End -of-Contract Handover Report. Detailed as per clause \n16 of the Contract Data are also to be stated in this report.  \n \nThe report shall accompany the Contractor‟s request to the Employer for releasing the \nPerformance Security. The handing over report will also be subject to verification of \ndetails of work completed vis -à-vis Contract scope by the Third Party Agency to be \nengag ed by the Authority for the purpose. Submission and Approval of the above report is a \nprerequisite for issuing by the Employer of the Final Payment Certificate and release of \nthe Contractor‟s Performance Security.  \n \n \n Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n186 \n 6. Specifications for Emergency Works  \n \n6.1. Definition of Unforeseen Natural Phenomena  \nEmergency Works are designed to repair those damages to the roads under contract which \nare caused directly by unforeseen natural phenomena with imponderable consequences \noccurring either in the area of the roads or elsewhere, but with a direct impact on the \nroads. “Unforeseen Natural Phenomena” are defined as follows:  \nFlooding where water levels rise above the crown level of the road resulting in complete or \npartial washout of the culvert or road embankment causing disruption of traffic.  Any \ndamage which  results from insufficient maintenance of drainage structures will not be \nconsidered as “emergency” and will need to be repaired from within the Routine \nMaintenance Services.  \nMajor landslides (greater than 50 m3) wh ich block the road carriageway and drains, \nencroach onto the road surface and interrupts the flow of traffic or is unsafe.  Can be \ncaused by heavy rains or earthquakes. Landslides within the right -of–way caused by \noverflow of poorly maintained cut -off drai ns or catch dams will not be considered as an \n“emergency” and will need to be removed as part of Routine Maintenance Services  \nTraffic accidents which interrupts traffic and causes insurmountable damage to the road.  \nNevertheless, the Contractor will be res ponsible to provide full support to the police and \nroad users and arrange signing and cleanup of site or sanding as necessary is part of \nRoutine Maintenance Services.  \n6.2. Procedure for Requesting Emergency Works  \nIf damages clearly caused by “Unforeseen Natural  Phenomena” result in a reduction of \nService Levels below the normal threshold values specified in this contract, the Contractor \nmay make a formal request to the Engineer to carry out Emergency Works designed \nspecifically to remedy those damages. If the Co ntractor decides to make a request for \nEmergency Works, he must (i) immediately inform the Engineer of his intention to do so, \nby telephone, radio or other means, (ii) document the circumstances of the Force Majeure \nevent and the damages caused, through ph otographs, video and other suitable means, (iii) \nprepare a written request, stating the type of works he intends to carry out, their exact \nlocation and the estimated quantities and costs, including photographic documentation. In \nany case, a request for Eme rgency Works must be made immediately after the Contractor \ngains knowledge of the existence of damages caused by “Unforeseen Natural Phenomena”.  \nThe Engineer, upon receipt of the request and not later than 24 hours thereafter, will \nevaluate the request ma de by the Contractor based on a site visit, and issue an order to \ncarry out the Emergency Works. The order will specify the type of works, their estimated \nquantities, the remuneration to be paid to the Contractor and the time allowed for their \nexecution. T he order may indicate a requirement for an engineering/geotechnical \nassessment of the options for the permanent repairs to the site.  \n6.3. Remuneration of Emergency Works  \nEmergency works are remunerated by the Employer for each work order on the basis of \nestimated quantities, the unit prices being stated in the Schedule of Prices, and in \naccordance with the relevant clauses of the GC. The work items and the unit prices to be \napplied are specified in Section IV (Bidding Forms - Bills of Quantities) of this bidding \ndocument.  \n  Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n187 \n In the event of unforeseen events, works shall be conducted as Emergency Works (Day \nworks). These Works shall be undertaken under Day works only where formally approved by \nthe Engineer. Works carried out under Day works shall be for min or items of works which \nare not within the scope of Bill 1, 2 or 3 activities. The Contractor shall maintain detailed \nrecords for the items of plant or materials utilised under Day works and shall obtain the \nEngineer‟s Surveillance Officer‟s endorsement of  the site dockets to verify times and \nquantities used.  \n \nIn emergency incidents, where the emergency work is beyond the scope of RM \nresponsibilities and not listed in the schedule, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer a \nfull listing of costs in accorda nce with the rates tendered in Schedule 4 – Unit Item Rates \nof this document. Once the site has been made safe, the Contractor is not to proceed with \nremedial works until the approval of the Engineer is received.  \n \n7. Specifications for Emergency Works  \n7.1. Provision for Emergency Works  \nThe total contract amount will include provisional quantities of Emergency Works during \nthe contract period, in accordance with the bidding data. The actual payments for \nEmergency Work will be based on the tendered rates. The Emergency Works also includes a \nProvisional Sum allowance in accordance with Clause 60 of the General Condition in the \nevent of addition unforeseen work is ordered by the Engineer.  \n7.2. Obligations during Emergency Events  \nGiven the nature of this contract and the fact that Emergency Works are remunerated \nseparately, the Contractor will, during the execution of Emergency Works, continue to be \nresponsible for assuring the normal Service Levels on all roads included in the contract. In \nparticular, the Contractor w ill do everything reasonably possible to ensure the normal use \nof all the roads under contract, including the sections affected by emergencies.  \n \nIf road traffic has been interrupted because of an emergency, the Contractor will follow \nthe provisions of the  Traffic Management Plan included in his Quality Assurance Plan and \ntake the measures necessary (i) to reopen the road to traffic in the shortest time possible, \nand (ii) to maintain the road open during emergency works, without being entitled to a \nspecific  compensation for those measures. This relates particularly to trees or other \nobjects which may have fallen on the road, damage to access ramps to bridges, erosion of \nembankments, collapse of slopes, traffic accidents, flooding, etc.  \n \nThe Contractor will not be subject to payment reductions for the partial or full traffic \ninterruption on roads that are caused by events necessitating the use of Emergency Works \nfor rectification, provided that he acts according to these Specifications.  \n \n7.3. Repair of Minor Damag es \nIf the works necessary to remedy damages caused by an “Unforeseen Natural Phenomena” \nare below certain threshold values, the Contractor will carry out those works as part of his \nnormal obligations  / routine maintenance  and without having the right to invoke the \nprovision of the contract concerning emergencies and the remuneration of emergency \nworks. In these cases the consent of the Engineer is not needed and the Contractor will \nsimply carry out the works on his own ini tiative. He will nevertheless inform the Engineer \nof the damages occurred and the remedial measures taken.  \n \n \n \n Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n188 \n  \n \n \nThe threshold values for minor repairs shall be defined as shown in the table below:  \n \nActivity  Unit Threshold Quantity per \nemergency event  \nSlides of material onto road  m3 50 \nWashing out of Culverts  Number  1 \nBituminous  concrete  m3 20 \nDense Bituminous  Macadam  m3 50 \nConcrete  m3 5 \nEmbankment  m3 250 Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n189 \n PART -II \n \nSPECIFICATIONS  FOR ROAD  MAINTENANCE  WORKS  \nAND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES  \n \n1.

The TMP \nmust have been approved by the Employer before the Contractor commences work that \naffects traffic flows or pedestrian safety. It shall show the methods to be applied to \nensure (i) that traffic can continue to use the road safely and with only the inevitable \ndegree of disturbance, (ii) the safety of road users and of people near the road. Th e \nTMP shall show the location, types and numbers of traffic safety devices, barricades, \nwarning signs, flagmen, by -pass roads, deviations and the like to be deployed under \nvarious types of work sites and traffic restrictions, such as the partial and full c losure of \ntraffic lanes, closure of road shoulders and moving roadside activities such as grass \ncutting, etc. It shall also cover the removal of all necessary traffic diversions and the \nreinstatement of the land used for such diversions. In the preparation  of the TMP the \nContractor must ensure a reasonable balance between the efficiency of his work \noperations and the minimization of disturbances for road users, including pedestrians \nand non -motorized traffic.  \nThe Traffic Management Plan establishes the practices for traffic management at work \nsites. The Traffic Management Plan must be developed by the Contractor and agreed with \nthe Engineer. The Contractor shall effectively implement all traffic management \nrequirements in accordance with MoRTH Clause 112  and contract Technical Specifications \nin respect of all works under the Contract.  \nThe objectives of the Traffic Management Plan are to:  \n Clearly define and document the responsibilities and chain of command for the \ndevelopment, implementation and managemen t of traffic control measures and \nsystems  \n Establish the minimum requirements for temporary traffic control  \n Establish the minimum geometric, cross section and surfacing standards for \ntemporary works  \n Provide appropriate transitions and enable safe and effici ent traffic flow into, \nthrough and out of work sites  \n Protect the Contractor‟s personnel at all times  \n Protect the Assets and the Contractor‟s resources at all times.  \n Meet the operational requirements for the road  \nThe Traffic Management Plan must include at least the following:  \n A documented process for preparation, review and approval of the Traffic \nManagement Plan  \n A document tracking and control system to ensure that only the latest operative \ncopy of the Traffic Management Plan is in circulation  \n Contact deta ils for Contractor, Principal emergency services and other stakeholders  \n Layout diagrams, method statements etc for implementation of traffic control while \nundertaking each aspect of the Services (including site specific layout diagrams and \nmethod statement s if the Services require traffic control measures not covered by \nstandard codes of practice)  \nThe Delivery Time for the initial Traffic Management Plan shall be not later than 21 days \nafter the Start Date.   Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n191 \n If a particular situation arises which is not ad equately foreseen in the Contractor‟s general \nTMP, the Contractor must prepare a specific TMP for that situation and submit it for \napproval to the appropriate authorities (traffic police, local authorities, etc.). Such specific \nTMP must also be prepared wh enever works are planned near schools or other places with a \nhigh concentration of pedestrians.   \nThe cost of implementing the TMP is deemed to be included in the rates or prices for \nrectification Works, Emergency Works, and Routine & Periodic Maintenance Services.  \n2.2 All maintenance works on the road shall be carried out in a manner which would \ncause least interference to the traffic. In stretches where resurfacing or riding quality \nimprovement works are to be taken up, the Contractor during execution of work  shall \nprovide and maintain proper passage  for traffic.  Where  it is not possible  or safe to allow  \ntraffic  on part width  of the carriageway, a temporary  diversion  of proper  Specifications  \nshall be constructed  by the Contractor  at his cost. The Contractor shall take prior approval \nof the Engineer regarding traffic arrangements during construction.  \n2.3 All arrangements for traffic during construction shall be considered as incidental to \nthe work and shall be Contractor‟s  responsibility.  The Engineer  shall determine  the penalty  \nto be imposed on the Contractor for deficiency in compliance to the requirement.  \n \n3 Quality Control  \n3.1 Quality control on materials and workmanship is the primary responsibility of the \nContractor. Quality control shall be exercised in accordance with the Quality Plan \napproved by the Engineer.  The Engineer may, during and after construction test the \nquality of materials and work in order to verify conformance with the prescribed \nSpecifications. To meet the requirements of the Contract, the Contractor would submit \nOperation and Maintenance Manual within 15 days of mobilization on ground. Every year \nmaintenance schedule would also be submitted by the Contractor. Engineer would review \nand approve the Operation and Operation an d Maintenance Manual and Maintenance \nschedule, and the Contractor would carry out the work in line with the approved \nOperation and Operation and Maintenance Manual and Maintenance schedule  \n \n4. Operational Procedures  \nThe Operational Procedures described in thi s Section are to be applied in the \nimplementation of Performance Based Maintenance Contract (PBMC).   \n \n4.1 Inspection and Payment of Maintenance Services  \n \nThe Contractor‟s compliance with Operational Performance Measures (OPM‟s) is to be \nassessed and verified through Formal Inspections, Informal Inspections, and other \ninspections. This section specifies (i) the procedures to be applied for scheduling and \ncarrying out Inspections and (ii) the application of payment reductions in cases of non -\ncompliance of the Co ntractor with required Service Levels or other requirements.  \n \nThe Inspections required to be conducted under the Contract, measurement of \nOPMs, MPMs, Documentary submissions etc. shall be conducted through smart devices \n(e.g. Mobile phone, Tablet etc.) or IT solutions as prescribed by the Employer from time \nto time. However, in case, no IT solution in  form of Web app / Maintenance app \n(developed by employer) is available with the employer then the defect notification Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n192 \n through simple email / letter shall be considered as official communication.  This \nincludes but not lim ited to reporting of defects by Contractor, AE/IE or the Employer, \nsubmission of action taken reports by Contractor, verification of ATR by AE/IE, \ncalculation of financial liabilities etc. making own arrangement of any necessary devices \n(Smartphone, Tablet , Computer etc.) as required.  \nThe Payment for the work done as determined by the Contractor and certified by the \nAE/IE will also be linked to the Web App based uploading of details of the work done with \nreference to the Inspections so carried out as per d irections of the Employer from time to \ntime in this regard.  \n \n4.1.1  Formal/ Verification Inspections by Engineer  \n \nThe main purpose of the regular Formal Inspections is to verify the correctness of the \ninformation presented by the Contractor in the Action Taken Report of remedial measures \nabout his own compliance with the Service Level requirements. The results of the Formal \nInspections are used for finalizing the monthly Interim Payment Certificate.  \n \nFormal inspections are scheduled in advance by the Engineer/ Employer and carried out \nby the Contractor through his team with participation of the Engineer. The regular F ormal \nInspections may be scheduled by the Engineer/ Employer once the Contractor has \nsubmitted the ATR of remedial measures for any defect.   \n \nThe Employer /Engineer must inform the Contractor‟s Self -Control Unit of the date and \nhour of the beginning of th e Formal Inspection at least 12 hours in advance. The \nscheduling of inspections between the Employer and the Contractor‟s Team must be in \nwriting, which may include the use of e -mail or Web App/ Maintenance App. The \nEmployer shall use the official e -mail a ddress of the Contractor which the Contractor must \nindicate in writing to the Employer at the beginning of the Contract period.  \n \nFormal Inspections can also be scheduled to verify if the Contractor has remedied the \ncauses of earlier non -compliances within  the time frame (Grace Period) granted by the \nEmployer. Failure to correct non -compliances within the specified Grace Period will lead \nto further payment reductions for those non -compliances in the following Interim \nPayment Certificate.  \n \nThe Contractor is obliged to be present at the date, hour and location specified by the \nEmployer, providing the physical means (including equipment) needed for the inspection. \nBoth must have a signed hardcopy of the Contractor‟s Action Taken Report of remedial \nmeasure in ha nd. The main purpose of the Formal Inspection is to verify the information \nprovided by the Contractor in his Action Taken Report, for his own compliance with \nService Level requirements.  \n \nShould the Contractor fail to appear for (or participate in) a sched uled Formal Inspection, \nhaving been requested to do so with at least 12 hours‟ notice, then the Employer/ \nEngineer may carry out the Formal Inspection without participation of the Contractor´s \nstaff. In such case, the determination of the Employer as to th e nature and extent of the \ndefects and non -compliances detected shall be final and binding, with no possibility of \nappeal or objection by the Contractor.  \n \nDuring the Formal Inspection the Employer and the staff of the Contractor shall travel in \nthe same v ehicle along the road and stop as necessary, while verifying the information \nprovided by the Contractor in the Standard EXCEL Compliance Tables. This is to ensure \nthat the Contractor is immediately aware of any non -compliances identified by the Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n193 \n Engineer/ E mployer. During the Formal Inspection any errors, discrepancies or \nmisrepresentations in the Compliance Tables presented by the Contractor, as well as their \nlocations and length, must be noted by the Engineer, communicated verbally to the \nContractor, and c orrected on the Compliance ATR for Maintenance Services. The Employer \nshall also indicate in the verified Action Taken Report any Grace Periods granted in \naccordance with the Specifications for remedying the various non -compliances and inform \nthe contactor  accordingly.  \n \nThe Engineer must inform the Contractor of his intention to carry out a formal inspection \nat least 12 hours in advance, indicating the exact date, hour and location where the \nformal inspection is to begin. The Contractor is obliged to be pr esent at the date, hour \nand location specified by the Engineer, providing the physical means needed for the \ninspection.  \n \nIn addition, the Employer shall also record any existing non -compliances which had \nalready been recorded during the previous month(s) and which have not been remedied \nby the Contractor within the Grace Period granted by the Engineer, and apply the \ncorresponding payment reductions for the full duration of the non -compliance.  \n \nDuring the formal inspection, the Engineer will prepare a brief  Memorandum in which he \nshall (i) describe the general circumstances of the Formal Inspection, including date, road \nsections inspected, persons present, etc., (ii) show a list of all non -compliances detected \nw.r.t Action Taken Report during the Formal Insp ection and (iii) show the Grace Periods \ngranted by the Engineer to the Contractor for remedying each non -compliance. The \nspecific Grace Period for each non -compliance shall count from the last day of the Formal \nInspection during which the non -compliance wa s detected.  \n \nThe Employer shall use the corrected Monthly Compliance Tables for Maintenance Services \nfor calculating the payment reductions for OPM‟s (and MPM‟s if applicable), and the total \namount to be paid for Maintenance Services. The Employer will th en immediately transmit \nhis Memorandum and the corrected Compliance Tables to the Contractor, as input for the \nContractor‟s Monthly Statement.   \n \nIf the Employer does not send his corrected Compliance Tables to the Contractor by the \n7th day of the calendar  month, the delay shall be added to the Contractor‟s deadline for \nsubmitting his Monthly Statement, which is normally due on the 10th day of the calendar \nmonth as per the General Conditions.     \n \n4.1.2  Self-Inspection by the Contractor  \nThe purpose of this inspe ction is for self -assessment of the important aspects of road \nmaintenance which impact the road safety and traffic flow on the road. These inspections \nshall be done by the Contractor itself to identify the defects on the stretch. The \nfrequency of these ins pections can be daily, weekly, bimonthly or monthly as per \nfrequency of measurement defined in Annexure -E of Part -I of Section -7. Contractor shall \nsubmit the inspections reports to the Engineer mentioning the defects identified during \nthe inspection in wri ting (through email) or Web App/ Maintenance App.  \nDaily Inspections by Contractor:  All works being executed on a day shall be reported in \nthe daily report by the contractor and also defects w.r.t to the most important items to \nbe reported in this inspection. A tentative list of items for guidance are as under:  \n(i) Potholes  \n(ii) Raveling/ Ruttin g/ Cracking  \n(iii) Embankment Slope Protection & Rain cuts  Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n194 \n (iv) Edgedrop at shoulders  \n(v) Unevenness, vegetation growth & water stagnation on shoulder  \n(vi) Drainage Condition  \n(vii) Cleanliness of median & Vegetation affecting sight lines  \n(viii) Missing or deformed or non -reflective road signs/hazard markers  \n(ix) Missing or damaged crash barriers  \n(x) Road Studs  \n(xi) Pedestrian Guard Rails  \n(xii) Non-functioning Highway Lighting/Solar Blinker/ECB  \n(xiii)  Riding quality at expansion joints  \n(xiv) Cracks/ settlement/ tilting/ spalling of all elements of sub -structure & super \nstructure  \n(xv) Cleanliness and functionality of toilets  \n(xvi) Theft or Vandalism of any highway asset  \n(xvii)  Encroachment of NH Land  \n(xviii)   Damaged Vehicles/ Dead Animals/ fallen trees, poles, debris on road.  \n(xix) Works executed on the day for the RFI/IFI Raised.  \n \n4.1.3  Weekly Joint Inspec tion by Contractor and Engineer  \nThis inspection shall be conducted jointly by the  Engineer and the Contractor. The \npurpose of this inspection is to ascertain the service levels maintained by the Contractor \nand also to ensure that the defects are being rep orted accurately by the contractor \nduring their Daily Inspections. Further, the items to be inspected/ reported in weekly \ninspection are specified in Annexure -E. The geotag enabled video recording of the entire \nstretch during the inspection shall be done b y the contractor through camera attachment \non the MMU.  \n \n4.1.4  Monthly Inspection by Contractor & Engineer with Employer  \nThis would serve as the performance review of the service levels assessed by the \nengineer/ contractor which would also be used for interim payments calculation along \nwith assessing the deductions and penalties.  \n \nNote:  Inspections w.r.t. all such requisite items/ assets defined in Annexure -E shall be \ncarried out as per specified frequency of inspection.  \n \n4.1.5  Bridge and Major Culvert Inspection (Bi -Annually)  \nThe reason for Bridges‟ and Major Culverts‟ inspections is to ensur e that the Contractors \nare undertaking the required care of bridges and major culverts, other than those easily \nseen during the monthly Conformance Inspection.  Generally detailed bridge inspections \nare not considered necessary as part of the Conformance I nspection as they are slow and \ntime consuming but should be undertaken at least six monthly or after any major flood.  \nItems requiring inspection are all defects, which may affect the structural integrity of the \nstructure including joints, superficial dama ge, batter protection and stream scour.  \n \nDefects to be \nidentified  Inspection Requirements  \nCulvert and pit repair  Bridge and Major Culvert Inspections are to be carried Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n195 \n Structures  out by an experienced officer of the Contractor initially \nwithin 3 months of  Start Date and then on a regular 6 -\nmonthly basis or immediately after flooding, which \nincludes detailed visual inspections of all bridges and \nmajor culvert structures for all structural defects, \nsuperficial damage, batter defects and stream scour.  \nThe inf ormation collected shall be submitted \nincorporating all the defects pointed in the Inspection \nas per Performa prescribed by the Engineer.  \n \nHowever, If during regular inspections, any defect in any Cross Drainage works / \nstructures comes in the notice of the Contractor / Engineer / Employer, then Contractor \nhas to do the detailed inspection of that Cross Drainage work / structure and take the \nremedial corrective action as per the contract.  \n \n4.1.6  Night Inspection (Monthly)  \nThe reason for Night Inspections is to ensure that when driving at night the road is safe \nand signs easily visible.  It will also provide the Contractor and the Engineer with a \ndifferent view of the road under night time driving conditions that may highlight \ndeficiencies that are not clearly vi sible during daylight hours.  Conducted monthly, the \nNight Inspections are to identify defective/non reflective or missing, signs, delineators, \nguideposts, hazard markers, pavement markings and any potential hazards to the \ntravelling public at night.  \nThe s peed should be kept to a level that allows the condition of the listed assets to be \nobserved clearly and serviceability easily assessed and recorded.  \n \nDefects to be identified  Inspection Requirements  \nSign maintenance  \nGuideposts, delineators \nand painted trees  \n Night Inspections are to be carried out by an \nexperienced officer of the Contractor on a monthly \nbasis by driving all roads in each direction and to \ncover Standard Jobs as indicated by Inspection Type \n“N”  \n \nThe speed should be kept to a level that a llows the \ncondition of the listed assets to be observed clearly.  \nThe information collected shall be submitted \nincorporating all the defects pointed in the Inspection \nas per Performa prescribed by the Engineer.  \n \n \n4.1.7  Emergency Inspection  \nEmergency inspection is carried out, following notice by Engineer or the Employer.  \n \nDefects to be identified  Inspection Requirements  \nPavement cleaning  \nCulvert and pit cleaning and \nstormwater drains  \nCulvert and pit repair  \nStream maintenance  \nStructures  \n Emergency Inspections are to be undertaken by \nthe Contractor immediately when notice is given, \nby the Engineer or Employer including:  \ncallouts to road safety/traffic emergencies  \nobservation of a drainage structure, bridges and \nsurface drains during and after heavy rainfall or \nfloods;  \nobservation of safety barriers and road surface is Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n196 \n safe after a road accident; and  \nlandslip sites : The site is to be immediately \nmade safe, an estimate of equipment and \nmaterials required for re -establishing \n(temporarily) the facility.  \nThe informati on collected shall be submitted \nincorporating  all the defects pointed in the \nInspection as per Performa prescribed by the \nEngineer.  \n \n4.1.8  Informal Inspection by Engineer/ Employer  \nThe Engineer/ Employer will also carry out Informal Inspections of the roads covered by the \nContract. The Employer/Engineer may do so on his own initiative, at anytime and anywhere \non the roads included in the contract. The Employer/Engineer must use his o wn means for \nthose inspections. If the Employer detects any road sections where the Service Level criteria \nare not met, he shall promptly inform the Contractor in writing (which may be by e -mail or \nWeb App/ Maintenance App) of the defect identified, includ ing its location within 12 hours, \nin order to enable the Contractor to take remedial action as soon as possible.  \n \nThe conduct of Informal Inspections by the Employer and the notification of any identified \nnon-compliances in no way affects the requirement for the Contractor to continuously \nmonitor road conditions and his own compliance with required Service Levels, and to rectify \nall defects. It is the duty of the Contractor‟s team, not of the Engineer, to identify defects \nand ensure their rectification in a timely manner.  \n \n4.1.9  Other Inspections  \nCommencement of the Contract – initial hand -over Inspection:   The Employer and the \nContractor shall both actively seek to undertake a joint inspection of the roads included in \nthe contract when handing over the site to the Contractor, unless agreed otherwise \nbetween the Contractor and the Engineer. The purpose of t his Hand -over Inspection is to \nprovide the Contractor with the opportunity (i) to eliminate jointly with the Employer any \nuncertainties over the precise location of the Contract boundaries and the start and end \npoints of any road or road section, and (ii) to highlight any locations or areas where \nsignificant deterioration or damage has occurred between the time of bid submission and \npossession of the site, as a direct result of unforeseeable events and/or natural phenomena \nwhich have occurred during that ti me period (but not due to normal wear and tear resulting \nfrom road traffic). If such deterioration or damage has occurred, the Contractor shall \ninclude a detailed description of the damage and a price quotation for its repair, for \nconsideration of the Empl oyer.  \nThe initial hand -over Inspection shall also be used to take time -lapse (or “hyper -lapse”) \nvideo footing for all roads included in the contract, to establish a record of the road and its \nimmediate environment at the beginning of the Contract. This ca n be done using the time -\nlapse video function available in all modern smartphones. [Note: It is recommended that \nthis is made a requirement for the Contractor to fulfil at the beginning of the Contract.]   \nIf the joint hand -over inspection is not carried ou t for any reason, the Contractor must \nnevertheless inform the Employer within 45 days after the Start Date of any damages or \ndefects which may have occurred during the time period between the submission of the \nContractor‟s bid and the Start Date, for the r emedying of which the Contractor plans to \nseek compensation from the Employer. Failure of providing such information within 45 days \nafter the Start Date shall be interpreted as such damages or defects being non -existent.  \nThe Contractor shall also highlight  any other impediments to the Contractor‟s program that \nare the result of encroachments, the actions of other contractors, or social or \nenvironmental issues and grievances requiring the Employer‟s intervention. The Employer \nand the Contractor may also take  video and/or pictures of the roads during this Inspection \nto record the condition at the time of Handover.

Payment Reductions for OPM’s  \nPayment Reductions for non -compliance with Operational Performance Measures (OPM‟s) \n(herein non -compliance is defined as def ects which are not rectified even after the end of \nTime Limit prescribed in Annexure -E to bring the same within acceptable limit as \nstipulated service level defined in Annexure -E) are normally expressed and calculated as a \npercentage of the monthly lumpsum payment. This percentage is applied as First Day \nDeductions to non -compliance which persists after the completion of time limit for \nrectification, and for the length of road, whic h is non -compliant, with the minimum length \nbeing one (1) km. It is further clarified that the entire road will be divided into consecutive \n1 kilometer sections and any breach in service levels of such sections will lead to \ndeductions/penalties as per cont ract from the per kilometer lump sum payment for routine \nmaintenance. The basic principles to be applied for payment reductions  are the following:  \n  \n“First -day” Payment  Reduction:  Payment  Reductions  in general  are meant  for the \nContractor  to continuously  and proactively  identify  upcoming non -compliances and to carry \nout necessary remedial measures quickly. The “First -day” payment reduction in particular \nhas the objective to ensure that the Contractor remedies defects quickly within time limit \nfor rectifica tion prescribed in Annexure -E, without waiting for the verification Inspection as \nspecified in time schedule. The “first -day” payment reduction is the payment  reduction  for \none day of non-compliance on due date after lapse of the time limit for rectificati on in \nAnnexure -E. To be clear, “First -day” is the  immediately succeeding  day after last day of \nthe time limit given for rectification in Annexure -E. To be clear, “First -day” is applied \nimmediately at the instant the time limit given for rectification in  Annexure -E is elapsed \nand defect is not rectified. The reporting time, time limits for rectification and ATR \nsubmissions time are recorded at hourly if not minute basis as there are defects in Schedule Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n198 \n E which have rectification period specified in exact hours as well.  \n \nSuspension of further payment reductions through granting of Grace Period:  Payment  \nreductions  are generally  applied  for each day during  which  the non-compliance     persists. \nHowever, if the non -compliance may persist after specified time limit which is beyond the \ncontrol of Contractor then in order to avoid severe payment reductions and to provide  the \nContractor with the opportunity to remedy the non -compliance without incurring  any \npayment  reductions  (beyond  the permitted rectification period as per Annexure -E) Engineer \nmay grant Grace Period to the Contractor. The granting of the Grace Period (applicable only \nin cases where Contractor is not at default and request for Grace Period has been made \nbefore lapse of permitted rectification pe riod as per Annexure -E) shall suspend the “First -\nday” payment  reduction till completion of the Grace Period.  The Grace  Period  will \ntemporarily “stop the clock” for “ First Day”  payment reductions as well as additional \npayment reductions, for the duration of  the Grace Period after the “first day”.  If the \nContractor remedies the non -compliance  within the Grace Period granted, there will not be \nany payment reduction for  that same  non-compliance.  The duration  of the Grace  Period  for \ndifferent  types  of defects should not be more than 50% of the original Time Limit as per \nAnnexure -E and may be granted by the Engineer/ Employer for such delays for which proper \njustifications and reasons has to be submitted by the Contractor.  However, if the Contractor \ndoes NOT rem edy the non -compliance within the Grace  Period, besides the First Day \npayment reductions (for the month when the defect was identified) a further payment \nreduction for all days of non -compliance  as per Note 1 below (starting from the  next day \nafter “First Day” and till last day of the defect identification month) will be  applied. In \ncase, the non -rectification of defect is carried forward to the next month, then the “First \nDay” payment reductions for that month for that corresponding defect shall be deducte d \nautomatically on day one of that month and the additional penalty as per Note 1 below shall \ncontinue till such day the actual rectification of the defect is done by the contractor. In \ncase, the defect is still not rectified and is carried forward to yet another month, same \nmethodology for deduction as described above shall be used.  \nNote 1: In case no grace period is granted by the Engineer, additional payment reduction \nfor all days of non -compliance  will start from the  second day after the initial rectif ication \nperiod as specified in Annexure -E and repeated defect ignore penalty @ 1000/ - per defect \nwill also be levied until the non -compliance is remedied.  \nNote 2: If grace period for rectification of defect is required more than 50% then the \nEmployer has to examine and give necessary approval for the same.  \n \nContractor’s obligation to inform Employer about completed remedial measures:  As soon \nas the Contractor has remedied the causes of a non -compliance with an OPM, he is obliged \nto inform the Employer acco rdingly in writing which can be by e -mail (also through IT \nsolution or Web App/ Maintenance App) and to attach any supporting evidence, such as \nphotographs or video.  The Engineer shall then decide if a follow -up inspection must be \nscheduled to verify if t he Contractor has remedied the non -compliance, or otherwise if the \nEmployer accepts the evidence provided by the Contractor as proof for the non -compliance \nhaving been remedied. If the Contractor fails to provide such information to the \nEmployer/Engineer i n writing or as defined by Employer, the Engineer shall continue to \napply the further payment reduction until such time when he receives the information from \nthe Contractor on the remedial action having been taken.  \n \nCorrect Reporting of Compliance/ Remedi al Measure by the Contractor (OPM -11): If more \nthan 10% of the ATRs submitted by the Contractor in the invoice month M have been \nrejected by Engineer, then 5% of overall lumpsum deduction shall be applied for that month \nM. For eg. for the invoice month M, Let (A) be the total number of ATRs submitted by \nContractor and (B) be the subset of ATRs rejected by the AE. If more B/A*100 >= 10, then Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf Draft No. DFA/86299 Attachment:MoRTH Letter dt 06 June 2023.pdf \n199 \n deduction  will apply as 5%. It should be ensured that no ATR submitted in Month M is \npending to be decided upon by eng ineer (accept or reject) at the time of clearing the bill by \nEngineer.  \n \nNon-recoverability of payment reductions:  Payment reductions that have been applied \ncannot be recovered later, even after the non -compliance which has been the cause of the \npayment reduction has been remedied.  \n \nNo time limit for payment reductions:   If the Contractor fails to remedy a non -compliance \nfor which a payment reduction has already been applied during a Formal Inspection, the \nrespective payment reduction will continue to be applied in the same way to the following \nMonthly Statement(s) for that particular cause of non -compliance, until the non -compliance \nhas been remedied, without a time limit being applied.  \n \nMultiple non -conformances and limitation for payment reduction:  Paym ent reductions \ndue to specific non -conformances are cumulative. If a one -km section of road has several \nnon-compliances, then the payment reduction to be applied is the sum of the payment \nreductions for each individual non -conformance. When an OPM (such as  OPM-2) includes a \ngroup of Sub -Measures (e.g. patching, cracking in Pavement, Potholes, etc.), then if the \nroad suffers from several of these defects, the overall Payment Reduction is equal to the \nsum of each individual payment reduction per type of defec t. For accumulated OPM non -\nconformances within any one -km section, the maximum cumulative payment reduction in \none month shall however be limited to 100 percent of the monthly lump -sum amount for \nMaintenance Services payable for that one km of road.    \nThe calculation of Payment Reductions for OPM’s  is to be carried out as described below:  \nAfter  the verification of Action Taken Report (ATR) for any defect, the  Engineer/ Employer  \nshall apply  the payment  reductions  for repair  of that defect in  the following  way: \n For any non-compliances found during  the verification inspection , the day after lapse of \nthe initial rectification period as per Annexure -E is to be considered as  the “first  day” of \nnon-compliance.  The corresponding  “First -day” payment  reductions  must be applied  \nimmediately  for the current  month. Also, if the Contractor does NOT remedy the non -\ncompliance within the Grace Period besides the First Day payment reductions a further \npayment reduction as per Note 1 of Clause 5 above shall be levied.  \n Deleted  \n \n5.1 Sample Calculation for Non -Compliance of OPM -11 (Incorrect Reporting):  \nThis OPM refers to the correctness of the information provided in the Contractor‟s Monthly  \nCompliance  Tables  for Maintenance  Services.  Reduction  with OPM-11 is triggered if the data  \nset supplied by the Contractor in the Monthly Compliance Tables  for Maintenance Services \nfor a road is incorrect for more than 10% of the data on  ATR. Compliance with OPM -11 is \ncalculated by comparing the data supplied by the  Contractor in the Compliance Tables with \nthe verified data on ATRs  provided through the Inspection by Engineer as per schedule. The \npayment reduction is calculated as  follows:  \n[Insert the Table for Calculation of payment reduction for OPM -11.
