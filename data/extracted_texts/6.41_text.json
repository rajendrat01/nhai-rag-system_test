No. 279039)} Sub: Implementation of Bridge Inventory and Condition Rating System (BICRS) for Recording Asset and Health of Structures of all Projects reg: To ensure the Systematic Management and Safety of its Infrastructure Assets, the Bridge Inventory and Condition Rating System (BICRS) is developed based on the inputs received from Design Division. The System, accessible through NHAI One and the Datalake Platform, Enables Comprehensive Recording, Assessment, and Bi-annual Inspection of Bridge Structures across of all Projects. 2 The Features of BICRS will be as under: - a) Inventory of Structures: Establishment of a unified repository of all Structures, each assigned with a Unique Asset Identification Number. Comprehensive Recording of Structural Specifications, Geographical Coordinates, AS-IS Drawings and related Documentation. p Condition Assessment: Systematic evaluation of Structural Health based on Predetermined Rating Parameters: Identification of Structures that require immediate Remedial Measures, including the imposition of Traffic Restrictions or Suspension of Heavy Vehicle Movement, as applicable. Inspection and Reporting: Consolidation of historical inspection data, condition ratings, recommendations, and maintenance requirements into a centralized dashboard. 3_ The BICRS module is demonstrated during the Executive Committee (EC) meeting held on 18.03.2025, and it was decided to launch the System. 4 The Authority Engineer (AE) / (Independent Engineer) shall Record one-time Structural Specifications Details of all Projects under their jurisdictions on BICRS Platform using NHAI One app. and AS-IS Drawings and related Documentation can be uploaded on Data Lake Portal. The First Inspection of Structures must be completed using NHAI One prior to the upcoming Monsoon Season. Thereafter, Bi-annual Inspections will be mandated to maintain updated records on the System: 5 PD shall have to cross check the Data Recorded by AE/ IE during their monthly Physical Inspections and highlight their Comments, if any, or discrepancies between the recorded and Ground Reality. In addition, the PDs shall have to mandatorily carry out Inspections and Record the Structure Health Condition on NHAI One app. itself, within 15 for Structures rated 1 to 3 by the AE/IE: If the PD also assigns a rating of 1 or 2, a Re-inspection/ Remarks from the RO shall be required.
