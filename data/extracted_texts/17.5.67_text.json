Expediting construction of_Toll Plazas early tolling of_completed lengths_in public funded annuityL EPC projects: Earlier instructions have been issued for timely construction of toll plazas so that completed lengths are put to without delay: However, instances are noticed where the project length is completed, but toll plaza is not  ready: There are cases where   tolling of completed length is delayed badly due to lot  of time taken in the bidding  of toll plaza construction. The delays in putting the completed length to tolling has been viewed seriously [copy of DO letter dated 10.11.2014 of Secretary (RTH) is enclosed]  Hence, all ROs and PDs are instructed to ensure the following: () From now onwards, the construction of toll plaza shall be taken up along with the construction of the project. All ROs & PDs shall review the position in ongoing projects and take up construction of toll plazas immediately, if not taken up already. (ii) In case any completed length is not put to tolling and construction of toll plaza is getting delayed on account of any reason, such completed lengths shall be identified immediately and informed to CO Division: A new form of e-quotation has already been evolved by CO Division to cater for such cases so that the toll collection contractor makes temporary arrangements for tolling and then starts toll collection, while ROs/ PDs may continue with construction of toll plaza. 2. ROs & PDs may note that any delay in tolling of completed lengths will be viewed seriously and responsibility will be fixed. 3 This issues with the approval of Competent Authority: Encl: DO letter dated 10.11.2014 of Secretary(RTH) (V.K.Sharma) Chief General Manager (LA & Coord:) To: AIl officers and employees of HQ/ROs/PIUs/CMUs/Site Offices H1 M MML NHAL for tolling again",
