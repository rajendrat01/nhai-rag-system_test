As approved by the Executive Committee in its meeting on 13.07.2017 vide item no.310.21,, the payment of concession fee during subsistence of force majeure and interpretation of relevant clauses relating to force majeiire in the concession agreement is to be regulated in the following manner: For OMT Concessions: a) In case of occurrence of Force Majeure event, the Concessionaire shall be exempted  from payment of Concession Fee. However , the existence of Concession during that will continue uninterrupted keeping in view that Concession Fee is an annual obligation, though it is payable monthly. This is also in accordance with clause 5.1 and 26.11 of OMT Concession Agreement. b) Since the Concession Agreement provides for extension of Concession Period in such a scenario, the Concessionaire shall be required to pay the Concession Fee during the extended period as applicable at that time. The Concession Fee during the extended period shall be calculated based on the provisions of Clause 21.1 of the Concession Agreement: In case the Concessionaire is able to collect some user  Fee, then the extension of the Concession Period would take into account the portion of user Fee collected and therefore, the Concessionaire shall be required to pay proportionate Concession Fee with respect to the Fee collected by it; Further it shall pay Concession Fee during the extended period, which shall be calculated based on the provisions of Clause 21.1 of the Concession Agreement. Force Majeure Costs payable will be in accordance with the Clause 26.7 of the Concession Agreement and for determining such costs information contained in the Financial Package may be relied upon to the extent it is relevant.
