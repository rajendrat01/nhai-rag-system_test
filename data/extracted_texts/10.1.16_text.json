Manuals of specifications and standards for four-laning and six-laning of highways published by Indian Roads Congress (IRC) vide IRC:SP:84-2014 and IRC:SP:87-2013, respectively are generally   followed in preparation of   DPRs for the projects undertaken by NHAI: However, with the experience gained in the implementation of NHDP and the need for safety enhancement; it is felt in NHAI that these Manuals need to be reviewed. Pending the requisite changes in the Manuals, immediate need has been felt to incorporate certain  provisions in the DPRs in order to take care of future requirements and to improve road safety. These are detailed as under: 1 ROW land and related aspects: The land for any Expressway will be acquired with a RoW of 100 mtrs. (ii) As for the four-lane six-lane Highway Road Projects, experience shows that all the existing two-lane Roads requiring upgradation to 4/6-lane involve acquisition of land, shifting %f utilities, felling Of trees and other statutory clearances etc As such, keeping in view a futuristic approach; it has been decided that the land for any 4/6 lane Highway Road will be acquired with a Row of 60 mtrs irrespective of the width of the carriageway. (iii) Land (minimum 5 acres, length and depth preferably in the ratio of 3:2) shall also be acquired for establishment of Way-side amenities at suitable locations at distances varying between 30 to 50 kms on both sides of the Highway. (iv) All efforts shall be made to avoid any road alignment through National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, even if it requires taking a longer route bypass. However, where it becomes absolutely unavoidable and necessary to keep the alignment through such reserve forest restricted areas, land would be acquired with RoW of rot more than 30 mtrs. The cross-section in such areas may be kept as 3.25m, (shoulder Utility Corridor) 10.5m (three-lane one side carriageway) 2.5m (Median) 10.Sm three-lane   carriageway) 3.25m (shoulder Utility Corridor). Similarly, though it be difficult, while determining the alignment for any bypass, efforts be made to see if these could be along the revenue boundaries of two revenue estates  thereby minimizing the   compulsions of  land owners farmers for cross-overs to the other side: In case such an alignment is not found feasible,_ it should be ensured that access to common facilities for the local people (e.g. schools, Healthcare facilities etc:) is maintained only on oe side of the alignment, thereby minimizing the need for cross-over for day-to-day life being (2nd may",
