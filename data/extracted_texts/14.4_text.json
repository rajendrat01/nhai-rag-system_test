Sub: Permission for access to PetrollDiesel/Gas-retail Outlets in accordance with the provision of MoRTeH Letter No. RW-NH-33023/19/99-DO-III dated 17.10.2003 The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has pointed out several shortcomings and infirmities in the proposals sent for permission for setting up of new fuel outlets. Reports sent by Project Directors often do not conform to the provisions of the MoRT&H Circular No RW-NH-33023/19/99-DO-III dated 17.10.2003. It appears that Project Directors do not take this work seriously and either do not themselves inspect the site or do not compare the site conditions with the drawings provided by the applicant; Some of shortcomings noticed are mentioned in the enclosed list: Project Directors are expected to give proper attention to this matter so that these mistakes are not repeated,.
