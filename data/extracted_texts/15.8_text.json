No. 57701) Sub: Quality Inspection of NH Projects where the projects were awarded to Abnormally Low Quoted Bids. Quality of work in NH projects has been an area 0f concern and NHAI has been making all-out efforts to ensure delivery of projects with utmost quality standards. 2 However, it has been observed that the quality of construction, at times, does not get due attention and deficiencies at various levels have been reported. This aspect is more prevalent in the projects where the projects were awarded to Abnormally Low Quoted Bids. 3 Independent Teams from NHAI HQ are being deputed to carry out quality checks at sites of various projects currently under implementation. In order to ensure that the quality of works in such low quoted projects gets due attention, it has been decided that  independent quality inspections in such projects would be carried out more frequently by the teams from NHAI, HQ, preferably once in every 2-3 months period during construction. 4 Further , ROs/PDs are advised to undertake frequent and regular inspections of such projects and issue inspection notes so as to ensure requisite quality standards.
