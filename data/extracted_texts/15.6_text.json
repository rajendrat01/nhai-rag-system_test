Considering the revision in  1S.73,  Ministry of Shipping, Road   Transport & Highways vide letter NoRW/ NH-33041/3/2001- S&R(R)-VoL.III dated 4.8.2008   (copy   enclosed)  has issued   guidelines   regarding selection of an appropriate of bitumen based upon the viscosity grade: 2 NHAI vide policy circular 22/2008 dated 12.11.2008 (copy enclosed) issued instructions to use bitumen in all future projects and explore the possibility of use of  equivalent viscosity bitumen for ongoing   projects depending on the availability of the bitumen Now, the oil companies have started producing viscosity bitumen against penetration bitumen: In view of the easy availability of viscosity bitumen, it has been decided that only viscosity bitumen should be allowed on NHAI projects as per the latest IS 73.2006 guidelines. 3 As per the data collected, it is noted that the for modified bitumen such as penetration test, softening test, separation test, elastic recovery test etc: are not conducted at site laboratories due to non-availability of equipments. It is also observed inspections by PQ division that equipment for of viscosity of VG bitumen is not mostly available in the site laboratories  It should be noted that the site laboratory should have for testing of viscosity of VG grade bitumen and required equipments should also be available for conducting following tests on modified bitumen Penetration test (ii) Softening test (iii) Separation test (iv) Elastic Recovery test 4 This issues with the approval of Chairman (AK Singh) General Manager (PQ) To: AII NHAI/ ALL ROs/ ALL PIUs/ ALL CMUs to :Library , Hindi Officer Ht { Ue NHAL grade testing grade grade grade viscosity grade grade grade grade grade testing point being during testing grade facility point Copy",
