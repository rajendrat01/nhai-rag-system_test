With a view to avoid idling of funds, the PD NHAI, being the joint signatory, may ensure opening of savings bank account instead of current account and invest the amount in linked FDR for short periods. 2 The amount deposited in the  joint bank account for land   acquisition is accounted for under \"CWIP-Land\" and the joint bank account shall not be a part of books of account of NHAI In order to monitor the flow of funds, a memorandum account shall be maintained by the PD, NHAI in the following format & submit a copy of the same along with Trial Balance as at 31 March of each year Sl Opening Amount Interest Total Compensation Balance No. Balance in deposited earned during the to the the into joint during monthl year end of beginning account the the of the during the monthl monthl month monthl year year year year 2 3 5 (2+3+4) (5-6) Note Where the balance as per column no.7 does not tally with the balance as per joint account; 3 reconciliation statement should be prepared bringing out the discrepancies: Cont...2 #T T 7 NHAL paid",
