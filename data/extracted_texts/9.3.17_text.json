Consequently, no deduction is being made in payment despite use of lesser binder content: MoRT&H specifications for Road and   Bridge works   clearly lays down the minimum percentagelpermissible limit percentage of bitumen content and the rate for BOQ items are with a fixed percentage of binder content: The relevant clauses for such BOQ items clearly specify the price adjustment, up and down, for variance in actual percentage of bitumen Used: Accordingly, Technical Divisions are directed to ensure that all future contracts invariably include the complete description as per MoRT&H specifications including price adjustment clause for variance in actual binder content: Competent Authority has also directed for  removing the anomalies and introduction of cost adjustment clause in all such type of Agreements/Tenders This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority.
