Provided that such shall be levied on the basis of actual Gross Vehicle Weight as measured by a standardized static weighing machine to be installed by the Concessionaire at [each of] the Toll Plaza[s] and where no such weighing machine has been installed, the Concessionaire shall not be entitled to collect Fee for the next higher category of vehicles. Provided further that upon detection of overloading, the Concessionaire shall prevent the vehicle from using the Project Highway until the excess load has been removed from such vehicle and the Authority shall not be liable for any act of omission of the Concessionaire in relation to such vehicle or person driving such vehicle:' However, it has been   observed that the above  provision of MCA is not enforced strictly to prevent the road infrastructure from being damaged by overloaded vehicles  Therefore , all concerned are directed to ensure that these provisions of MCAs are enforced strictly. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. General Manager (CMC) to: AII Members AII CGMs GMs DGMs & Managers TT U H NHAL Fee being \"sgager au  Copy",
