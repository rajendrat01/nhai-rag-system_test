No. 252325)} Sub: Policy Guidelines for \"External Professionals in Information Technology Project Management Unit (IT - PMU)\" reg: 1. Background: 1.1 Chairman, NHAI approved the proposal to constitute IT-PMU in Feb 2022 to take up upcoming challenges in tapping the potential of the NHAI's IT Systems and to ensure deeper adoption of the IT systems in the Organization. 1.2 Initially, a team %f 05 Joint Advisors was envisaged to work as Product Managers, Data Scientists and GIS experts to provide Technical, Implementation, Operational, Integration and Procurement Support to NHAI'$ core IT Division. 1.3 As part of the Team, 02 Joint Advisors (GIS) in the first round of advertisement while 02 Joint Advisors (Product Manager) and 02 Joint Advisors (Data Scientist) were on boarded in the second round by Dec 2022_ 1.4 Between Dec 2022 and June 2022, 01 Joint Advisor (GIS) was transferred to LA Division while 01 Joint Advisor (Data Scientist) resigned_ 1.5   Subsequently, in June 2023, another advertisement was floated seeking 01 Joint Advisor (GIS) , 01 Joint Advisor (Data Scientist) and 03 Joint Advisors (Product Manager) considering the increased scope of work in Data NHAI Rajmarg Yatra App, etc. 1.6 After 03 rounds of advertisement with immense time and resources spent, only 05 Joint Advisors are presently part of the Team_ 1.7 Considering the poor accretion of manpower observed since the inception of the Team at NHAI; a need has been felt to redefine the existing Terms of Reference that, if adopted, could serve as incentives to retain manpower as well as attract experienced market Professionals. 1.8   Further, due to the evolving and dynamic scope of work prevalent in the IT Division, the Team and its strengthening is the need of the hour. The proposal is, therefore, based on a horizontal & vertical expansion model such that seamless transfer of duties with backups at every level would help in fulfilling the mandate defined for the Team with minimal 1.9 At present, the following reasons pose a challenge in strengthening of the existing Team engaged to execute the mandate defined by NHAI: a. differentiator: What differentiates the Joint Advisors in IT-PMU as compared with equivalents in other Tech: divisions is the fact that the latter are primarily retired officers (age 60 yrs) , whereas the incumbents in IT-PMU are skilled professionals in the age group of 25-35 years and presently working in IT industry, who expect reasonably longer tenure with career growth opportunities to leave their existing assignments and join NHAI:.
