It is observed that the prior approval of NHAI is taking time in View of various levels involved (PD,RO & HQ) thereby resulting in issuance of PCC/ CC with back date by the (eading to following resultant issues: NHAI is not in a position to start tolling of the completed section from the effective date of PCCICC, thereby losing toll revenues; 'ii) The proposal of AE for issuing PCC contains the Punch List in two parts viz List-A (minor outstanding works which have to be   completed within 30 days) and List-B (List of outstanding works which could not be completed due to non-availability of land or Authority'$ default)  Although List-A items are to be completed within 30 days of the issue of PCC, the EPC Contractors are actually getting more than 30 days time to complete the List-A items due to time taken in according prior approval by NHAI. Further, there is no control/ knowledge of NHAI- HQ on the works included in the List-B. (iii) EPC Contractor gets bonus for early  completion as per   provisions   in Cl.19.20 of EPC contract. Thus, issuing PCCICC with a back date leads to apprehensions about completion, particularly in cases where the payment of bonus is involved. 2 _ In order to overcome the above problems, it has now been decided to authorise the Regional Officers of NHAI to approve the proposals of the Authority Engineer to issue Provisional Completion Certificate in EPC projects, strictly observing the following: Sr_ EPC Gist of Clause relevant to Responsibility of Officer 0f NHAI No_ Contract the issue Clause 8.3 Cl: 8.3.2: Contractor agrees to (i) PD shall ensure handing over of all parts of the complete the works on all parts sites to the Contractor within the prescribed of the site for which timelines; In order to monitor timely handing over RoW is granted within of the sites, PD shall submit a quarterly report for the prescribed time each project to the RO with a copy to the Member (90 days from the concerned at HQ on the parts of the sites not Appointed Date or the handed over to the Contractor and the dates given in hindrances thereon alongwith an action plan to Schedule-A for some address these issues.
