The Executive Committee in its 116th meeting held on 29.08.2012 has decided the following regarding road safety issues in the ongoing projects: \"The issue regarding missing road safety features in the on going projects was deliberated. It was decided to issue letters to the Regional Officer to ensure implementation of road safety features covered under the Concession Agreement during the execution of the project. Similarly there are certain road safety items which are required to be taken Up Under the change of scope of work, such items after due justification should be up to the concerned technical division on case to basis for approval from concerned competent authority. To avoid and minimize such lapses in future in the TOR of feasibility consultants it is to be specifically mentioned that \"the consultant will certify that to the extent possible all safety feature required in the project has been taken care of in the project formulation and nothing substantial has been left\". 2 Above decision of the Executive Committee is circulated herewith for compliance by all concerned. 3_ This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. 1s/8 (V.K.Sharma) Chief General Manager (Coord./LA) To, Allofficers andemployees ot HQIZO[ROs[PIUs[CMUs/Site Qlices NHAL put",
