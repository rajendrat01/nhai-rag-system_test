M} Context sensitive checklist based incidents and accident management system procedure to ensure siandardized response across all stretches. Establishmenf of corridor control centre (ATMS Control Centre) typically located at fee plaza complex A single control centre to typically handle one project stretch depending upon factors 5uch as lolling length etc; within the scope: {iv) CCTV Surveillance and provide enforcement assistance. (v) Provision of Service Level Parcmeters to measure effecliveness of ATMS after it is implemented on a project stretch (vi) Mobile ApP to provide interface between control centre and road user for timely dissemination of information 3_ NHAIhas tcken the foilowing decisions: The standard document enclosed shall be incorporated in RFPs (Specifications and Standards} of all future projects, where ATMS is considered. The criteria lo go for ATMS in the projects is also modified, i,e ATMS is to be prescribed for all roads of NHAI being puf to tolling. i.e. even if trafflc is less Ihan 40,QQO PCUs] ATMS will be implemented on all 4-lane and above highways Contd; .P/2 MMtlL WHAAV key day,",
