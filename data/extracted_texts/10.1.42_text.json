It is observed that the   Consultancy Firms (as  IEZAEISC) are assigning Civil Project's Supervision obligations to the Authorized Person/ Designated 'Engineer' for many Projects. Due to more no. of Civil Projects in hand, the Authorized Person/ Designated 'Engineer' may not be able to fulfil Contractual obligations and ensure monitoring of the Field Team adequately and therefore defeats the purpose in reference to qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the Project, required as per the Contractual Provisions. 5 . In view of above, for improvement of Quality and Supervision Mechanism, it has been decided to restrict the no. of Projects to Maximum Limit of 10 Projects under Construction or Maintenance Stage per 'Engineer' of Consultancy Firms Contd_ 08 2/ - 5005 NHA Key for, to, for, to,",
