No. 56280) Sub.= Deletion of Provision of Underground Tunnels at Toll Plazas. Toll plazas are being constructed at designated points of National Highways for collection of fee from the road users. In order to avoid miscreant activities and attack o the toll collectors to snatch cash, the provision of underground tunnel was introduced. 2. In the present scenario electronic toll collection through FASTags is going to be mandatory for all vehicles. Further , Government is keen on moving to a system wherein 100 percent of the toll collected is through FASTag and no cash handling at toll plazas. Hence, toll booths for handli cash will eventually obsolete 3 In view of above, it has been decided to stop making provision of tunnels at the toll plazas from ongoing as well as future NH projects. 4_ All technical divisions may accordingly make required amendments in their bidding documents. Further , in case of works already awarded but work of tunnels completed less than 70% , notice for negative change of scope may be initiated with respective contractors/ concessionaires: 5 All technical divisions shall issue suitable instructions to DPR/Feasibility consultants also for all DPRs/Feasibilities under preparation. 6. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. (Sheo Shankar Jha) CGM (Coord.) To AIl officers of NHAI HQROs/PIUs/CMUs/Site Offices Copy to: 1. PS to Chairman 2. PS to AII Members/cvo 3 .
