It has come to our notice that varying practices are followed by different PIUs / CMUs in the matter of number of shifts per and their timings while managing collection of fee at the plazas. To bring uniformity, it has been decided that:- (i) All the plazas will have three shifts: - (a) First shift from 0.00 hours (midnight) to 8.00 hours; (b) Second shift from 8.00 hours to 16.00 hours; and (c) Third shift from 16.00 hours to 24.00 hours. (ii) Each booth will have a booth  number (e.g. 1,2,3. 4) written on all sides of the booth, visible both during and night. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority.
