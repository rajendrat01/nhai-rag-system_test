NHAI Policy Circular No. 7.2.11/2021 dated 06.01.2021 2. Ministry of Power DO No. 2/7/2017-Trans-Pt. (1) dated 19.08.2021 The delegation of powers to sanction the estimates of utility shifting and detailed instructions/guidelines for processing utility shifting estimates have been issued vide policy circular dated 06.01.2021 (copy enclosed)_ 2. Ministry of Power deliberated the issue of shutdown charges in the meeting taken by Secretary (Power) on 11.08.2021 and it was noted that generally customers of transmission lines are not affected by shutdown of a particular transmission line during the period of shifting of utilities, because of redundancy in the power system, therefore it was suggested that in case of projects of national importance (NHAI projects) , deemed availability may be given for the shutdown period availed by transmission licensees for shifting of their transmission lines, provided that transmission customers are not affected by the shutdown: It was also suggested that there is need for standardization of shutdown period, SO that deemed availability period is not   utilized for other than intended purposes 3 After detailed deliberations, Ministry of Power decided as under: - 1. In case of NHAI projects, Regional Power Committees (RPCs) Secretariat would provide deemed availability certificate for the shutdown   period availed by transmission licensees for   shifting of their transmission   lines, provided that transmission customers are not affected by the shutdown of the line. Shutdown charges would be computed by Central Electricity Authority (CEA) as per standard norms and would be included in the cost estimates to be provided to NHAI for shifting of lines. ii. Decision at para (i) will be immediately implemented: Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) shall also be requested to suitably modify their Regulations, so that RPC Secretariat can issue deemed availability certificate for the shutdown   period availed by transmission licensees for   shifting of their transmission lines in NHAI projects, provided that transmission customers are not affected by the shutdown of the line. iii _ CEA shall standardize the shutdown period required for such shifting works, so that deemed availability period is not utilized for other than intended purposes.
