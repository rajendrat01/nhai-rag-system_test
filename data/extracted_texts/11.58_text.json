No. 121370)} Sub: SOP to be followed for Calculating/ Stream lining the Financial  Implication for change in Tunnel Support System due to change in Rock Classification/ -reg: For the Projects  consisting of Tunnel, both EPC Contract  Agreement and HAM Concession Agreement provides for Geotechnical Base Line Report. Further the Agreements have provisions to cater for deviation from Geotechnical Base Line Report (GBR) under Article 13 (for EPC) and Article 16 (for HAM): The Cost variation is factored in the form of Cost matrix and have been incorporated in the Contract/Concession Agreement (CA) to account for change in support system due to deviation in actual rock classification from baseline report: 2_ The Financial Implication formula for the HAM projects and EPC project are given in the Contract/Concession Agreement under the respective clauses of Change of Scope i.e. Article 13 for EPC and Article 16 for HAM: 3_ During implementation of various Tunnel Projects, it has been noticed that there is variation in rock class with respect to Geotechnical Base Line Report (GBR) available in the Contract/Concession Agreement: The length of the Tunnel is provided in cumulative length for different category or chainage wise bifurcation of rock class in Geotechnical Base Line Report: The financial implication worked out as per formula given in the Contract / Concession Agreement is envisaged to be treated as \"In-Principle\" approval for Positive or Negative Change of Scope (CoS) for change in support system. Though at the same time, it needs to be observed carefully so that quantum of CoS is approved timely and Cash Flow to the Contractor/ Concessionaire is maintained and delay in Project completion is minimized: 4_ Following SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) has been approved by the Competent Authority in order to stream line the process of above CoS proposal received from Contractor / Concessionaire: 4.1 The Objective of the above SOP is to create credible documents duly checked from independent Third Party wherever required from time to time and to ascertain the actual rock mass classification encountered at site so that matter of Change of Scope (+ve/-ve) may be taken up swiftly without hampering the progress of the project 4.2 The Contractor shall submit its Geological Information Report (GIR) as determined after detailed investigation with design to AEIIE & Authority along with expected variation in the rock class, if any from the GBR. AE/IE will submit detailed comments on GIR to Authority with any expected financial implication. However, this GIR is advance action on part of assessment of probable CoS only and will not have any bearing on value of (-/+) CoS which shall be determined based on actual rock class encountered with GBR: Contd_2I- '91 U U 91 NHAL Type. along",
