The allegations of collusion of Consulting Firms & Contractors/ Concessionaires where IE/AEISC is not appointed before award of civil works and ridiculously low bids quoted by IE/AEISC in some cases have also come to the notice. 2 In order to streamline the appointment of IE/AEISC, it has now been decided that the financial bids of Civil Work Contracts will be opened only after the award of IEIAEISC Contract. However, the commencement date of IE/AEISC Contract may be given only after Appointed Date of Civil Work Contract. If any inputs of consultant's team are required prior to this due to work requirements, the same may be allowed with approval of Member concerned: 36+up5 (R K Pandey) Member(Projects) All Officers at HQROs/PIUs/CMUs/Site Offices: '%1 RTRI AL NHAL May,_ prior",
