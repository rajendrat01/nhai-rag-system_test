Technical Schedule A,B,C, D   \nNHAI - RFP for Appointment of Safety Consultant  \n44 \n Schedule -III \n(See Clause 2.3.3)  \n GUIDANCE NOTE ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST  \nGuidan ce Note on Conflict of Interest  \n1.  This Note further explains and illustrates the provisions of Clause 2.3 of the RFP and shall \nbe rea d together therewith in dealing with specific cases.  \n2.  Consultants should be deemed to be in a conflict of interest situation if it can be reasonably \nconcluded that their position in a business or their personal interest could improperly \ninfluence their  judgment in the exercise of their duties. The process for selection of \nconsultants should avoid both actual and perceived conflict of interest.  \n3. Conflict of interest may arise between the Authority and a consultant or between \nconsultants and present or future concessionaries/ contractors. Some of the situations that \nwould involve conflict of  interest are identified below:  \n(a) Authority and consultants:  \n(i) Potential consultant should not be privy to information from the Authority which is not \navailable t o others; or  \n(ii) Potential consultant should not have defined the project when earlier working for the \nAuthority; or  \n(iii) Potential consultant should not have recently worked for the Au thority overseeing the \nproject.  \n(b) Consultants and concessionaires/ contractors:  \n(i) No consultant should have an ownership interest or a continuing business interest or an \non-going relationship with a potential concessionaire/contractor save and except \nrelationships restricted to project -specific and short -term assignment s; or \n(ii) No consultant should be involved in owning or operating entities resulting from the \nproject; or  \n(iii) No consultant should bid for works arising from the project.  \nThe participation of companies that may be involved as investors or consumers and  officials of the \nAuthority who have current or recent connections to the companies involved, therefore, needs to \nbe avoided.  \n4.  The normal way to identify conflicts of interest is through self -declaration by consultants. Where \na conflict exists, which ha s not been declared, competing companies are likely to bring this to \nthe notice of the Authority. All conflicts must be declared as and when the consultants become \naware of them.  \n5.   Another approach towards avoiding a conflict of interest is through the use of “Chinese walls” \nto avoid the flow of commercially sensitive information from one part of the consultant’s \ncompany to another. This could help overcome the problem of availability of limited numbers \nof experts for the project. However, in reality eff ective operation of “Chinese walls” may be a \ndifficult proposition. As a general rule, larger companies will be more capable of adopting \nChinese walls approach than smaller companies. Although, “Chinese walls” have been relatively \ncommon for many years, th ey are an increasingly discredited means of avoiding conflicts of \ninterest and should be considered with caution. As a rule, “Chinese walls” should be considered \nNHAI - RFP for Appointment of Safety Consultant  \n45 \n as unacceptable and may be accepted only in exceptional cases upon full disclosure by a \nconsul tant coupled with provision of safeguards to the satisfaction of the Authority.  \n6.  Another way to avoid conflicts of interest is through the appropriate grouping of tasks. For \nexample, conflicts may arise if consultants drawing up the terms of reference o r the proposed \ndocumentation are also eligible for the consequent assignment or project.  \n7.   Another form of conflict of interest called “scope –creep” arises when consultants advocate \neither an unnecessary broadening of the terms of reference or make rec ommendations which \nare not in the best interests of the Authority but which will generate further work for the \nconsultants. Some forms of contractual arrangements are more likely to lead to scope -creep. \nFor example, lump -sum contracts provide fewer incenti ves for this, while time and material \ncontracts provide built in incentives for consultants to extend the length of their assignment.  \n8.  Every project contains potential conflicts of interest.

This report also \ninclude s identification of blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  based on number of accidents  \nand fatality . Accident records is also related with the traffic volum e on the project road to \ndetermine accident trends in relation to the traffic volume.  \n \n2.0 SAFETY  CONSULTANT  TEAM   \nThe following are the key professionals of this safety consultan t assignment : \nTable 1 Name of the key /sub-key professionals of the safety consultan t \nS. \nNo. Position  Key/Sub -Key Name  \n1 Senior Road Safety Auditor cum \nTeam Leader  Key   \n2 Traffic Planner  Key  \n3 Road Safety Assistant/  \nApprentice  Sub-Key  \n \n3.0 DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT ROAD  \nWrite project road description in a few sentences  including start and end locations as well as \nstart and end chainages.  (An index plan of the project highway may be included on the \nGoogle map).  \n \n \n4.0  COLLECTION OF ACCIDENT DATA  \nThere are ----------- (actual) number of local police stations namely …… , ……… , and ……… \nin the jurisdiction of the project road.  Detailed road accident data is collected  in the NHAI’s \nroad accident format from the FIR s of the road accidents for  the last three years .  \n \nRoad accident data collected is annexed as Annexure -I. \n \n \n  Template for Collection and Analysis of Road Accident Data to Identify  \nthe Blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  \n \n2 \n   \n5.0  CLASSIFICATION OF ACCIDENTS    \nThe data collected from the police station (i.e. from FIR), which is  in their own format and in \nregional language. This has been translated into English  language and transf erred  on the \nformat of NHAI ’s road accident format  (Annexure -I). \nThe acc idents are classified according to the degree of serious injuries or death during the \ncrash /accident . The accident  severity rating used by police is as follows:  \n A fatal accident  is one where at least one fatality happened.  \n Grievous injury accident is one where an in jury requiring hospitalisation and report ing \nto police station.  \n Minor injury accident is one where injury requiring no hospitalization/reporting to \npolice station.  \n Non-injury accident is that in which only the vehicle was damaged and nobody was \ninjured during accident.  \nThe accident details of the project highway collected from the police stations for the last \nthree years are summarized location -wise (for each kilometer stretch of the project road) \nand annexed as Annexure -II. This is known as kilo meter analysis.  \n \n  Template for Collection and Analysis of Road Accident Data to Identify  \nthe Blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  \n \n3 \n  \n6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF BLACKSPOT /ACCIDENT PRONE LOCA TIONS  \nThere are two methods for determination  of blackspot /Accident Prone Locations : \n1. Based on Accident Severity Index  \n2. Based on MoRTH Protocol  \n \n6.1 Based on Accident Severity Index (ASI)  \n6.1.1 Determination of Accident Severity Index (ASI)  \nBased on the accident data collected, Accident Severity Index (ASI)  is computed  to identify the \nhazardous locations on the project corridor . \nIn order to quantify the criticality of an accident site, a system of assigning scores has been \nadopted based on the severity of accident. The score termed as Accident Severity Index (ASI). \nAccident Severity Index is a dimensionless value indicating the level of hazard of a spot on the \nroad.  \nThe following equation has been used:  \nASI = (Nf x Wf) + (Ng x Wg)  + (Nm x Wm)  \nWhereas,  \nNf = No. of fatal accidents at the spot  in the last 3  years  \nWf = Weightage assigned to fatal accident is 6 \nNg = No. of grievous injury accident s at the spot in the last 3 years  \nWg = Weightage assigned to grievous accident is 3  \nNm = No. of minor injury accidents at the spot in the last 3 years  \nWm = Weightage assigned to minor accidents is 1  \n \n  \n  Template for Collection and Analysis of Road Accident Data to Identify  \nthe Blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  \n \n4 \n  \n6.1.2 Identification of Blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  \nLocations where the road accidents take place or tend to cluster together are commonly known as \n“Accident Prone Locations ” or “Blackspots”. Blackspots /Accident  Prone Locations  may be Nodes  \n(junctions/intersections) or Links (m id-block location between adjacent nodes) or any specific \nstretch of road with land uses close to the road . \nThe hazardous spots are prioritized based on Accident Severity Index (ASI) and St andard \nDeviation.  \nStandard deviation is a measure of variability in statistics and probability theory. A low standard \ndeviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean, whereas high standard \ndeviation indicates that the data points  are spread out over a large range of values.  \nHazardous spots with Accident Severity Index (ASI) more than Threshold value (Average Severity \n+ 1.5 times Standard Deviation) is considered as  “Accident -Prone” or “Blackspot”  locations.  \nThus, Threshold value =  Average of ASI +1.5 times standard deviation  \n    =  ̅       [   ] \n    )) \nWhere V =V 1, V2…………  Vn are the ASI values of locations 1, 2……………...n.  \n  = Average ASI value =              \n  \nWhere N is the total number of ASI values . \n \nBlackspots or accident -prone locations are the locations, which have the ASI values more than the \nthreshold value and are indicated  in Table below  \nTable: - Identification  of Blackspots based on ASI Value  \n1 Km \nStretch  Accident \nLocation  \n(Km)  Number of \nFatal \naccidents in  \nthe last \nthree years  Number of \nGrievous \nInjury \nAccidents in \nthe last three \nyears  Number of \nMinor  Injury \nAccidents in \nthe last \nthree years  ASI \nValue  \nSeverity Weightages  \n6 3 1 \n      \n      \n      \n      \nAverage   \nStandard Deviation (σ)   \nAverage+(1.5x Standard Deviation )   \n \n \n \n  Template for Collection and Analysis of Road Accident Data to Identify  \nthe Blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  \n \n5 \n  \n \n \n6.2 Based on MoRTH Protocol  \n \nThe Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) defined the protocol for identification of road \naccident blackspots on National Highways in their Circular No. RW/NH/15017/109/  2015/P& M \n(RSCE) dated 28.10.2015, as follows:  \nRoad Accident Blackspot is a stretch of National Highway of about 500m in length in which either 5 \nroad accidents (in all three years put together involving fatalities/grievous injuries) took place \nduring the last 3 c alendar years or 10 fatalities (in all three years put together) took place during \nthe last 3 calendar years.  \nTable – Identification of Blackspots based on MoRTH Protocol  \n1 Km \nStretch  Accident \nLocation  \n(Km)  Number of \nFatal \naccidents \nin the last \nthree years  Number of \nGrievous \nInjury \nAccidents in \nthe last three \nyears  Total \nNumber of \nFatal and \nGrievous \nInjury \nAccidents \nin the last \nthree \nyears  Number of \nFatalities/Deaths \nin the last three \nyears  Blackspot \nas per \nprotocol \n(Yes/No)  \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n \n  \n  Template for Collection and Analysis of Road Accident Data to Identify  \nthe Blackspots /Accident Prone Locations  \n \n6 \n  \n \n7.0 TREND BETWEEN ACC IDENT RECORDS AND TR AFFIC VOULME AT \nBLACKSPOT /ACCICENT PRONE LOCATIONS  AND PRIORITIZATION  \n7.1 Trend between accident records and traffic volume  \nAppreciat ion of trend between  total number of accidents and traffic volume at each blackspot \nlocation  is discussed in this section.

audit of the rehabilitation and widening of a \nhighway between km 86.0 and km 142.0  \n2.0 Audit Team  \nThe audit team comprises of members including a Senior Road Safety Auditor  \n3.0 Project Background  \nA 56 Km section  of highway  is to be rehabilitated and widened.  This section  of highway  \ncommences  in a flat area of rural land and is basically  straight  and flat for the first half until it \nreaches  a wooded  hill area  for the second 28km.  An 80km/h  design  speed  has been  used  for \nthe flat section  and a 60km/h  design  speed  has been  used  in the hill section.  The highway  \npasses  through  two towns  and eight  villages.  Ten new bus lay-bys are included  in the \nproposal.  No change is proposed to the six existing bridges.  . (An index plan of the project \nhighway may be included here showing its alignment on a Google map).  \n4.0  Audit Details  \nThe road authority  requests  a road safety  audit  of the DPR.  The Project  Manager  selects  a \nroad safety audit team  and provides  him with the ToRs  for the audit.  The senior  auditor,  on \nviewing  the size and stage  of the project,  invites  a colleague  to join him in the audit  team.  \n4.1 The Project Manager has the design team provide the audit team with a complete set of the \nlatest drawings, as well as the design report for the project.  \n4.2  The team then travels to the location of the proposed highway rehabilitation; they \ninspect the entire length during day and night. The audit team also inspect s the highway for a \nfew kilometres outside the 56km long section in order to check that those nearby areas won’t \nbecome high risk locations after the work is finished and traffic speeds increase.  \n5.0  Safety Audit   \nFormat of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template. All the titles of \nissues as listed in the checklist are reproduced to impress that all issues as in the checklist \nshall be verified and all issues shall be report ed with exact location in the road safety audit of a \ngiven road.  \n \nTemplate for Road Safety Audit Report (Design Stage)  \n \n2 \n No Safety Concerns & Audit Findings  Recommendations  Client ’s \nAcceptance & \nCompliance with \nDate  Description (with images if any) Risk  \nDescription (with figures if any)  Priority  \n5.1 Horizontal & Vertical Alignment  \n5.1.1 The left hand curve near km 128.9 has a much shorter radius \nthan any other curve in this section of the highway. It will be \none of the “sharpest” curves on the entire highway. Some \ndrivers/riders, especially those travelling westwards (downhill) \nmay be caught by surprise at the small radius of this curve, \nand run - off-road crashes could result. The drawings are silent \nabout what is intended to address this ri sk. Very  \nHigh Review the design  to increase the radius \nof this curve.  Desirable   \nIf this is not feasible , ensure that the \nshoulders are paved on both sides of the \nhighway for at least 100  m either side of \nthe apex of the curve.

Essential  \n5.2 Typical cross sections  \n5.2.1 The drawings show a 1.5m wide unpaved shoulder along both \nsides of the highway. Unpaved shoulders discourage \nvulnerable road users from walking/riding on them as shown in \npicture (especially during the monsoon period). They become \ndamaged when heavy vehicl es drive on them. This can lead to \ndeep drop -offs from the pavement which in turn becomes a \nhazard for small vehicles. There are many pedestrians, \nbicyclists and motorcyclists using this highway. They need the \nprotection of a paved shoulder.  High Review the proposed cross section  to \nprovide a paved 1.5m wide shoulder \nalong both sides of the highway for the \nentire project highway .

The Project Manager decides  to \nengage  an audit team of three members  as he considers that this highway improvement is a \nsignificant one that will benefit from a larger audit team. The Project Manager ensures the team \nsize is made clear in the ToRs for the audit.  \n4.1 This is the first safety audit that has been conducted on this project. No design stage audits \nwere conducted. The Project Manager decides to hold a Commencement Meeting to discuss \nthe project and the audit.  \n4.2 The audit team begin s by undertaking a “desktop” audit of the traffic management plans for \nthe construction work and subsequently carried out th e audit.  \n5.0  Safety Audit   \nFormat of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template.

The highway commences in a flat rural area and leads into a hill area . The 4 -lane \ndivided carriageway comprises  of 2x 7.25m wide carriageway with 1.5m wide paved \nshoulder and 4.5m wide median  and 2 -lane road section comprises of 7m wide pavement \n(2 x 3 .5m wide lanes) and unsealed 1.5m wide shoulders on both sides. Km 76 to 86 km of \n4-lane section has not been audi ted in the design stage. But the km 86 to 142km has been \naudited and as a result i n the towns and villages, within one kilometre of each and on \nselected curves, the shoulders have been sealed as a result of the DPR stage audit \nrecommendations.  (An index pl an of the project highway may be included here showing its \nalignment on a Google map).  \n4.0 Audit Details  \n4.1 The road authority requests  a road safety audit of the new work. The Project Manager \ndecides to engage the same audit team which had previously (20 months earlier) audited the \nDPR drawings as he felt they had done a professional job before and were quite familiar with \nthe project. The Team Leader decides to add an extra member to the audit team, a young \nengineer experienced in the safety of vulner able road users.  \n4.2 The audit team spends time inspecting the finished roads as well as the drawings  to \nconsider as what recommendations can be included even at this stage of pre -opening audit \ncausing least disturbance to contract and time over run.
