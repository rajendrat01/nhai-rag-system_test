The delays in project completion due to such COS/RIS attracts various claims from Contractors/ Concessionaires related to idling, loss of overheads, toll escalation etc. 2 In view of the above, the Executive Committee has directed to discourage Change of Scope in awarded works. Change of Scope/ Reduction in Scope in case of awarded project shall be finalized during the project design /development stage and incorporated in the project with the approval of the Competent Authority of NHAI within six months of Appointed Date. In exceptional cases, Change in Scope may be taken up after six months of Appointed Date duly recording the reasons/justifications for delays in identifying COS. For under implementation projects, where Appointed Dates have occurred to six months from the date of these guidelines, pending COS/RIS proposals shall be decided and  approved within 30 days of these guidelines. Reduction in scope, if any, due to non-availability of land or any other valid reasons shall be decided as soon as noticed and shall not be left open. delays in this regard shall be viewed seriously and action will be taken against errant officers. 3 Executive Committee has also directed that while proposing Change of Scope/ Reduction in Scope, the reasons for deficiency in scope of awarded work shall also be examined for necessary administrative action on the consultants/officers of NHAI, if required. 4_ This issues with the approval of Chairman: z9/0 4 (V.K.
