Ref: Circular No.11041/217/2007-Admn: Dated 24.12.2010 1. It has been observed that a large number of legal cases are filed especially in land acquisition matters against NHAI/PIUs and the Counsels generally draft a similar reply/counter affidavits/rejoinder/written statement etc and till the disposal of the case, the pleadings remain similar, barring the changes of titlelcase nos. etc. (which reflect the name of applicant, plot no. and other details of land etc being acquired by NHAI) and otherwise pleadings remain almost similar. NHAI Counsels just replicate the reply/counter affidavits/rejoinders /written statements etc without any original input therein and charge 509 after 3 cases in accordance with the captioned circular, which is felt to be on the higher side. 2 In view of the above, the following is clarified and payment to the Counsel/Law Firm in such a situation may be regulated as under: (a) Where the cases are filed in one and the same court or any Authority and matters are similar (not materially different) which are heard as bunch matters and pleadings like filing of reply, counter affidavits, rejoinders, written statements etc are also similar, then, for first three cases, the payment may be made full as per the captioned Policy Circular's schedule and 50% upto 10 cases, and thereafter, 10% for rest of the cases_ (b) In so far as the payment towards appearancelhearing of case is concerned, in bunch matters, the appearance will be counted as one in respect of all matters. 3_ The above   clarifications are issued in  partial   modification of the   Circular dated 24.12.2010 referred to above, to this extent and other conditions of the circular  shall remain unchanged. 4 This issues with the approval of Chairman. jla Raj General Manager(Legal) All Officers at HQs CVO AlI PIUs/CMUs/SPVs All ZOs/ROs/SLOs Copy for information to: PS to Chairman 7 { M NHAL 19th",
