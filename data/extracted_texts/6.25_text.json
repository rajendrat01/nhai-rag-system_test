NHAl/11018/01/2008-PQ Comp. No. 54149) \nSub: Updation of project specific information on Project Management Software/ Data \nLake Portal by AE/IE. \nRef: NHAI/Policy Circular No. NHAI/IT/Data Lake/05 dated 21st April 2020. \nThe directions for uploading all correspondence related to the project on Data Lake \nPortal were issued vide Policy Circular of NHAI dated 21.04.2020. All the correspondence between Concessionaire/Consultant/Project Director/Regional Officer pertaining to the \nprojects are to be exchanged through this portal only. \n2. Directions have further been issued vide NHAI's Policy Guidelines No. 6.24/2020 dated \n03.11.2020 for uploading the project specific information such as all project documents, \nvideos, photos, test reports, NSV reports, FWD reports and road inventory reports. It was also \ndecided that all Contractors/ Concessionaires/ Consultants should mandatorily submit the bills \nin the PMS/ Data Lake only and no physical bills should be accepted from 17.09.2020 for \npayments. \n3. It has been observed that most of the Consultants are still not regularly updating and \nuploading the required information on the Project Management Software/ Data Lake Portal \nand the Authority is unable to ascertain whether the consultants are performing their tasks as \nper the provisions of Terms of Reference (TOR). \n4. All PDs are therefore directed to processthe payments of consultants only after \nascertaining that all the detailsrequired to be uploaded on Data Lake have been completed/ \nupdated by IE/AE. \n5. This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. \n(Sheo Shankar Jha) \nCGM (Coord.) \nTo \nAll officersof NHAI HQ/ROs/PIUs/CMUs/Site Offices \nCopy to: \n1. PS to Chairman\n2.
