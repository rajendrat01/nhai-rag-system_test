The covers are frequently broken leading to unsafe conditions, as drain cover serves as footpath also at many places. The poorly constructed  drains, with   frequently  broken covers and with no outlets, have become waterlogged mosquito breeding places, resulting in filthy looking sites (vii) heavy covers which are impossible/ difficult to be lifted manually, making cumbersome to clean the drains: (viii) No integration is made with the municipal storm water drainage system in urban areas thereby leading to low or no utility of these drains. (ix) The inlets of drains are higher than the road surface in many places leading to water logging and no/ low utility of these drains. The natural drains in the area which are crossing the road have been blocked by the longitudinal highway drain without giving any thought for their integration thereby stopping the natural drainage system and flooding the area. xi) Due to the above reasons; by making stereo type drains, we are wasting public money, adding to the problems of traffic jams and also creating dangerous and waterlogged filthy sites: Crdd 2 41 RT RT MI NHAL Very",
