No. 196097)} Sub: Regarding Densification of Plantations including Planting of Bamboo, Initiating the Plantations in ROW from the Appointed date, Conservation of Existing Trees in ROW at the time of Initiating the Construction of Highway-reg: 1 Densification of Plantations including Planting of Bamboo The plantation activities are being carried out on National Highways as per the SOP of NHAI and technical specifications of Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines. Presently, the specifications of spacing between plant to plant and row to row in the road side avenue plantations prescribed in IRC:SP:21:2009 are being followed. The spacing between row to row is 3 m and plant to plant in various rows are as follows: st Row: 3 m ii. 2nd Row: 6 m jii. 3rd Row: 8 to 12 m These avenue plantation spacing were reviewed and discussed in VC meeting on 17.03.2023 and after thorough discussion, it was decided that spacing between plant to plant in all the rows should be reduced to 3 m for densification of the plantations which will help in faster greening of Highways. The spacing between row to row will remain to be 3 m but the spacing between plant to plant in various rows will be kept as follows: 1 1st row: 3 m ji. 2nd row: 3 m iii. 3rd row and subsequent rows: 3 m The post planting operations like watering, weeding, casualty replacement and protection of plants etc: as prescribed in the IRC: SP: 21-2009 guidelines shall be followed without fail. The densification of plantations will be applicable to existing as well as future plantations. It has also been decided that the bamboo plantations should be taken up during 2023-24 and subsequent years, wherever possible at the edge of the ROW of National Highways particularly in the Controlled-Access Highways at a spacing of 3 to 4 m between plant to plant where more than 2 rows of avenue plantations are possible in the ROW. Post planting operations like watering, weeding, casualty replacement and protection of plants etc. for the bamboo plants shall also be followed as prescribed in the IRC:SP:21-2009. Contd__2I - 91 ?
