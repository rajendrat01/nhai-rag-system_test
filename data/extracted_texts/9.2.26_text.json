NHAI/CMD/2019/9 of Contract Management Division] Sub Interest Bearing Working Capital Advance against unbilled executed work to mitigate the cashflow problems of Contractors of EPC Projects. The Authority (NHAI) has awarded many projects on Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Mode in which the payments for the works carried out by the Contractors are made as per  provisions of Article-19 (Payments) of the Contract Agreement: The Stage/ Interim Payments as per Article-19 are governed by the provisions in Schedule-H of the Contract Agreement: 2 _ The cashflow issue had been earlier identified by the MoRTH/NHAI and requisite modifications had already been made in Schedule-H: However, it has been observed that despite clear   provisions on the obligations of the parties and all favorable conditions to execute the works, there are instances where the Contractors could not demonstrate the progress of work due to reasons of poor planning; lack of resources, poor mobilization, financial problems of the Contractor'$ Company, lack of external financial support, etc. Also, knowing fully well the payment conditions; the Contractors quote the cashflow problem due to executed works not qualifying for payment under stage payment conditions stipulated in Schedule H. 3 . In order to revive the projects facing such cashflow problem and complete the projects early, Executive Committee in its meeting held on 01.08.2019 has decided to extend the facility of Interest Bearing Working Capital Advance against unbilled executed work, not qualifying for payment under stage payment conditions, in the following manner: (i) The revival of the project is possible by extending this facility. (ii) Such Working Capital Advance shall be available only once during the construction period against the work done, which could not be billed: (iii) On   receipt of request from EPC Contractor for   Working   Capital  Advance, Authority' s Engineer (AE) shall determine the value of work done, which could not be billed and is not qualifying for payment under payment conditions: NHAI stage",
