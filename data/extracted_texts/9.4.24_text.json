The provisions of concession/contract   agreements also give enough powers to the Authority to take up maintenance activity at the risk and cost whenever contractor   (for EPC projects)   and Concessionaire (in case of BOT (Toll)/ Annuity/HAM/TOT /OMT) failed to rectify the defects deficiencies notified by IE/ AE/ Authority. However, complaints regarding poor O&M and lack of due care and attention to O&M activities are being received from the various quarters. This reflects the lackadaisical approach in attending to these activities resulted in severe public criticism, besides leading to costlier interventions at a later stage. 2 In order to further   streamline the process and   provide dedicated attention to maintenance, following were decided; a A division has been created at HQ This cell shall be responsible for highway operation, RAMS , road safety engineering and maintenance_ To begin with, this cell will start with maintenance activity only. The cell will be headed by a CGM and report to the Member concerned for overseeing maintenance and processing of proposal of maintenance. b_ Issue of delegation has also been raised by the field units: It has been decide to increase the earlier limit of 10 crores to Regional Officer to 15 crores. Similarly, Project Directors are entitled for sanction of estimates up to 1 crore. C On implementation, reference is invited to Policy Guidelines No. 9.4.23/2021 dated 02nd March 2021. Despite above instructions, instances have come to notice wherein either NSV  survey was not conducted or NSV data was not analysed thus compromising the proper maintenance of the stretches. One of the reasons cited by the field units was non-availability of agency to take up NSV survey: Now powers are delegated to ROs to engage agency within the cost on which agencies have been empanelled in the region. d_ Reference is also invited to the NHAI Circular No_ NHAI/HO/Priority Maintenance/ 47892/2021/E-334783 dated 13th December 2021 for Rectification works based on the observations of NSV survey conducted and its updation on Priority Maintenance Module in Datalake. In this regard, an updated new module named \"Priority Maintenance\" in datalake was developed and HAM projects under O&M The relevant defects identified through NSV survey report are being mapped in this module and the rectification maintenance work performed as per the relevant schedule of Concession Contract Agreement and updated on datalake. Further, planned start dates are assigned by the system. The Contractor Concessionaire will get a timeline of 7 days from planned start date to initiate the actual rectification work: Contd__.2I- HT 7 U 9 NHAL Reg:",
