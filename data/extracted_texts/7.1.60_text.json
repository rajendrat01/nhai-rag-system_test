It is intimated that a case of excess Land Acquisition in the State of Punjab resulting in considerable financial implications to NHAI has come to light while considering a high court order directing enhanced compensation: It is noted that acquisition of ibid excess land was on account of faulty DPR by the consultant and inadequate follow up supervision by concerned field offices while forwarding land acquisition notifications for publication. 2 _ The issue has been viewed seriously by the Chairman who has directed the following in respect of all future and ongoing projects:- (a) A certificate from ROs/PDs shall be taken personally confirming that only the bare necessary land is being  acquired for the projects, while granting sanction as per enclosed formats: (b) In addition, a similar certificate should be taken from the consultant while approving the payment on account of LA related work as per enclosed format. 3 Accordingly, all technical divisions and concerned field offices shall ensure strict compliance to the above directions while considering the cases for approval for payment to consultants for LA related work and while processing cases for sanction of projects. 4_ This is issued with the approval of the Competent Authority.
