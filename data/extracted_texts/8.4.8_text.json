Based On financial analysis, projects which require VGF' in excess of 20% of TPC would deemed to he unviable on BOT (Toll) mode. The projects proposals may be formulated on BOT(Toll) mode for all projects which, based on financial analysis, are prima-facie viable on BOT (Toll) with some estimated premium; iii) The projects proposals may he formulated hoth on BOT(Toll) a8 well as EPC mode for all projects which, hased on financial analysis, are prima-facic viable on BOT(Toll) with VGF requirement up to 20% of TPC. 2 For ensuring  wider participation by developers and keeping in view the present market   conditions, packaging of project   may be   suitably   structured to ensure that a8 far as possible TPC of a single EPC package should be around Rs.1,000 Crore. Similarly, & single BOT (Toll) package should normally be not more than 100-120 km. 3 It is requested that preparation of PPPACIEPC proposals as per above may he taken up on priority 80 that a shelf of projects is created which will facilitate speedy implementation of projects. 4 This issues with the approval of Competent Authority. 24 (V.KSharma) Chief General Manager (LA & Coord ) To: All officers and employees of HQROs/PIUs/CMUs/Site Offices 'fe7",
