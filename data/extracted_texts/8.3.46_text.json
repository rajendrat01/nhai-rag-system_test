No. 251358)} Sub: Clarification and Methodology to be adopted for acceptance of Boundary Wall constructed along Row (Right of Way) in Greenfield Alignments on NHs/Expressways reg: Ref: MoRTGH Circular No.RW/NH-24036/27/2010-PPP dated 04.02.2019(Copy Enclosed-A) In order to demarcate ROW to avoid any kind of encroachment and illegal access on the Highways, MoRT&H issued Circular cited in reference which provides guidelines for provision of Boundary/Toe Wall in all the NH Projects During various site inspections of many ongoing and completed Projects it has been observed that the provision of Boundary Wall at many locations are in variance from the drawings provided in the Concession Agreement IMinistry's Circular dated 04.02.2019_ 2 Some Contractors/ Concessionaires using design freedom (as permitted in EPCIHAM Projects) constructed Boundary Walls by adopting their own designs/drawings which is in variance to drawings indicated in MoRTH Circular dated 04.02.2019. It has been observed that there are certain deficiencies in the designs adopted and Boundary Wall work executed by the Contractor / Concessionaire at site. Some of those deficiencies are listed as under: (i) The mean probable design life considered was only 5 years [Clause 6.3.1 of IS 875(Part- 3):2015]. However the same shall be minimum 25 years considering the importance given to structure as the Boundary Wall is also serving the purpose of Security Wall [Note-3,Example-17;SP 64(S&T):2001] and moreover it shall match with mean probable   design life of other assets of the Project  being created under same Contract / Concession Agreement: (relevant abstract of IS 875 (Part-3) & SP 64 (S&T) Enclosed -B) (ii) Wind load parameters being considered for the design as per IS-875 (Part-3):2015 such as kz, k3, k4 and even Cf etc: for calculation of design wind speed to asses the wind load were not strictly conforming to Contractual Provisions/Site Conditions; (iii) The SBC cited in the drawing is not checked along alignment of Boundary Wall by the Contractor / Concessionaire by carrying out geotechnical investigations before construction (at a regular interval as per codal provision); (iv) A minimum depth of foundation below NGL has been indicated in the design but the same is also not ensured; Due to uneven NGL; stepping in Boundary Wall is to be done keeping oe level till difference in NGL is more than 450 mm. However the same is being done in the arbitrary manner. Contd_2I - 9 U U M NHAI K1, being",
