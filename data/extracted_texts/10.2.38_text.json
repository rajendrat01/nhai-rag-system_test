Based on the experience learnt and feedback received, the Attendance Management System (AMS) and the NHAI One Mobile App. has been upgraded to address the additional features for transparency, convenience, ease of adoption by all concerned_ The updated version of the NHAI One Mobile may be downloaded / upgraded from and iOS store_ 3. The additional features introduced to the Attendance Management Module are as under: Disable_Attendance:- The Project Director(PD) will now be able to temporarily disable/   suspend marking of attendance by any individual/ group of AE and IE personnels. This functionality will provide flexibility to Project Directors (PDs) to stop any misuse of AMS by AEIIE personnel coming to notice of the PD and take further actions. Location Mapping: - The PD will be able to track/ view the geographic location i.e. check-in/ check-out location of attendance marked by the Personnel/ Engineer across the Project under their jurisdiction: This feature allows for the review of location data not only for the current date but also for & range of preceding period, thereby enhancing transparency and tracability in location tracking: (jii) Liveliness Check: To address the identified vulnerabilities of the AMS, whereby use of static images for check-in/ check-out purposes were used by some of the AE/ IE/ personnel, the system has been integrated a liveliness check feature. This enhancement ensures that attendance records are based on real-time verification thereby reinforcing biometric verification: (iv) Image Re-verification Module: While on-boarding, the Sub-Key Personnel/ Engineers deployed by AEI IEI SC, the baseline photos were one time verified by the Project Director(s) at the time of registration. The issue of mismatch between baseline photo and the real time was reported: To enhance the accuracy of the image while  marking attendance with the baseline  image the functionality has been introduced wherein the Consultant can update its baseline images which shall be re- verified by the PD concerned. This feature not only aims to enhance the accuracy of the image but also ensure demobilization of resources as per contract provisions are entered correctly in the system_ Contd: 2/ - 40ud NHAL Key App: App: Key Key",
