Various utility owning agencies take lot of time in submitting the estimates, which goes in parallel during the stage of project implementation. The costs of these activities are determined by other Govt_ Dept. / Agencies resulting in variance in the estimated cost and the actual expenditure on shifting of utilities. There are number of cases where actual costs of   land  acquisition and other pre- construction activities like utility shifting, forest clearance, tree cutting, etc. as per actuals have exceeded the estimated costs. 3 At present; NHAI's ROs have been delegated with powers for approving land acquisition and utility shifting costs, as per project requirements, which are not limited to the estimated provisions. There are no specific guidelines for regularization of increase in expenditure of pre-construction activities of already approved & on-going projects. 4.
