Mostly, NHAI takes a position of claim rejection with zero amount and the Contractors/ Concessionaires present their claims with highest possible amounts. The Arbitration/ Court matters go by the contractual/ legal interpretations/ logics and once the interpretations/ logics are established, the Contractor / Concessionaire is awarded the claimed amounts: However , there may be a case wherein, if the interpretations/ logics of the Contractor/ Concessionaire are to be believed, the quantification of claim may not be as much as presented by the Contractor / Concessionaire and if such calculations were available before the Arbitral Tribunals/ Courts; it might have awarded lower amount: 3_ In view of the above, it has been decided that all Regional Officers shall ensure that in all the Arbitration/ Court matters of the projects within their jurisdictions, the arithmetic/ logical check of the claims of Contractors/ Concessionaires shall be done through the Engineer of the project; Project Director & Techno-legal expert and Opinion of NHAI on the calculations will have to be given by the field officers in all cases, Thereafter , same shall be forwarded by the Regional Officer along with his comments. While rejecting claims with zero eligible amount before Arbitral Tribunals/ Courts, the calculations arrived at by NHAI shall be  shared with the Counsel appearing on behalf of NHAI with the rider that \"without prejudice to the rights & contentions, the NHAI submits that assuming for the sake of argument; but not admitting that if the contention of the Claimant is found correct; the actual amount comes to Rs. 4_ Competent Authority approving such Statement of Defence/ Appeal/ Petition may also check such calculations arrived at by NHAI in the documents to be presented before the Arbitral Tribunals/ Courts.
