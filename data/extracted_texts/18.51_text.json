The construction work of road & \nstructures is coordinated by Project Directors (PDs) andofficers inPIUs, under a Regional \nOfficer (RO) reporting to Member through Technical Division at HQ. \n2. It has been observed that certain structural failures have taken place in the past \nduring currency of the construction period andalso during Operation & Maintenance period, \nleading to fatal accidents which are unfortunate happenings and call for stringent steps to \nprevent such incidents which are bringing bad name to the organization at large, apart from \ndenting image of construction industry and engineering fraternity. Further, these incidents \nseriously question the credibility of the technical expertise of the stakeholders involved, \nbe it design consultants, proof consultants, IE/ AE, contractors, concessionaires or PDs/ PIU \nOfficers concerned. Such accidents are a huge setback to the progress of the work besides \ncausing loss to the public life and property. \nWhile various circulars/ guidelines on quality/ inspection systems of NHAI/ IRC/ \nMORTH are available for prevention of such accidents, a proper Standard Operating \nProcedure (SsOP) needs to be spelt out to deal with such untoward incidents. 3. \nAccordingly, the following SOP need to be adhered to by all concerned to have a \nresponsive post-accident mechanism in place. 4. \nImmediately after receiving information on failure of any component of Road & ) \nStructures like Bridges, Flyovers, ROBs, RUBS, RE/ Retaining Walls, etc., ROs/ PDs \nconcerned will reach the site without any delay. While moving to the site itself, they \nshall manage over mobiles the rescue operations including moving the injured to the \nhospital. \n(i) After reaching the site, they will assess the dangers like hanging parts of structures, if \nany and take necessary precautions to prevent any further damage to life and property. \nAfter assessing the site situation, RO/ PD shall inform concerned Member/ CGM on \ntelephone within one hour of incident followed by e-mail report (preliminary) about \nthe accident within 3 hours dulytaking photographs/ video and samples for testing. \n(ii) In caseof casualty/ injuries, they will send a report to local District Administration in \naddition to the in-house efforts of taking thevictims to the nearest hospital. \n(v) Plan for traffic diversion, if required, on account of theaccident shall be put in place \nimmediately with the signages installed appropriately to guide thetraffic. \n(vROs/PDs will prepare a detailed report on collapse of Bridges/ Flyovers/ ROBs/ RUBs/ \nREWalls etc. as thecase may be andsubmit it to NHAI HQ within 24 hours. \nContd to Pg-2 -2 \n(vi) A Committee of 3 Experts chosen from the empaneled list in the field of Bridges/ Flyovers/ ROBs/ RUBs, etc. will be deputed by Tech. Division with the approval of \nMember concerned to visit the site within 24 hours in order to carry out technical analysis and analyze the reasons of failure along with fixing the responsibility for failure and submit its preliminary report within 3 days and final report within 7 days to Member concerned. \n(vii) Report submitted by the Expert Committee will be examined at NHAI HQ and deterrent actions will be initiated against individuals & firms responsible for the incident like Concessionaire/ Contractor & its personnel and Consultants & its personnel, AE/IE, Design Consultant, Proof Consultant, etc. including their debarment from NHAI \nprojects. Further, action against the officers of NHAl shall be taken, if found guilty of \ndereliction of their duty. \n(vii) Suitable remedial measures/ actions as suggested by the Expert Committee will be \ntaken by RO in a time bound manner to restore the damaged Bridges, Flyovers, ROBS, RUBs, RE/ Retaining Walls, etc. including restoration of further construction/ 0&M \nactivities. PD/ RO will submit daily ATR till remedial measures/ actions are completed. \nix) The Technical Report submitted by the Expert Committee and actions taken shall be \nshared with all the Technical Divisions, ROs and PDs to avoid recurrence of such \nincidents in other projects. \n(Amarendra Kumar) \nCGM (Cord.) \nAll Officers of NHAI HQ/RO/PIU/CMU/Site Offices \nCopy to: \nAll Members/CVO \nPS to Chairman \nHindi Division- for translation in Hindi ",
