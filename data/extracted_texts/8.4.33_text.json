Claims made by the Concessionaires regarding Equity contribution or Debt availed or expenditure made has been apparently left unchallenged while defending NHAl against such claims. Payments made in violation of waterfall of priorities were not identified to bolster NHAI's defense. In many cases while premium or other dues to NHAI were not being made, creating huge overdues, it appears that Escrow Banks were permitting withdrawals by Concessionaires. Such irregularities need to be challenged before the Arbitration Tribunals where cases are pending and in other cases, remedied by demanding immediate cure by Escrow Banks. To improve NHAI'$ defense and to secure our interest an SOP is devised as below which is required to be followed for strict compliance: Applicability: The SoP is based on Model Concession Agreement 2009 and applicable to all BOT projects however if there is variation in the clauses of SoP and the signed Concession Agreements, provisions of signed Concession Agreements shall prevail. 1.1 Relevant provisions of Concession Agreement & Escrow Agreement: As per the terms of the Concession in BOT Toll or Annuity and related Concession Agreements, wherever an Escrow mechanism is in place, it is hereby made mandatory to verify and ensure that all project cash flows, whether inflows or outflows have to be necessarily routed through the Escrow Accounts, except where the Senior Lender/s permit direct payment on account of certain exigencies. The following provisions are relevant in this regard: 1.1.1 Para 31.3 of the Concession Agreement provides as: \"Funds in the Escrow Account shall be applied in the serial order of priority set forth in clauses 31.3.1 and 31.3.2, as the case may be. If the funds available are not sufficient to meet all the requirements, the Escrow Bank shall apply such funds in the serial order of priority until exhaustion thereof _ It is, therefore, to be made absolutely clear to the Escrow Banker, Senior Lender & Lender's Representative that any deviation from the Waterfall of Priorities, such as making payment for an item lower in the Waterfall of priorities when payment of a higher priority is pending will be violation of the contractual arrangement between the Parties and action will be required to be taken accordingly, with the Escrow Banker becoming liable for damages: Contd__.2I- '9 7 U 91 NHAL May, Reg:",
